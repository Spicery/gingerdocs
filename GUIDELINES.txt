Documentation Guidelines
------------------------

* 	This section is intended to provide an overview to documenters as to where
  	information goes.

* 	The overall format is very flat. 
	- 	The Makefile is intended to impose any delivery structure that is needed

* 	File formats are all documented individually.
	-	They excludes the configuration files of particular tools
	-	which should be documented in the owning tools

*	Source tools which inject a source format into the toolchain are typically 
	documented with the file format. They effectively define the file format 
	from the viewpoint of the chain.
	-	e.g. common2gnx is documented under common.
	-	e.g. gson2gnx is documented under GSON.

*	Intermediate tools of the toolchain are documented individually.
	-	e.g. lnx2gnx is documented under lnx2gnx
		>	its configuration format is documented with it.
		
*	Sink tools of the toolchain which consume a source in a given format
	are typically documented in their own section. Many tools consume
	a single format.
	-	e.g. appginger and simplifygnx are documented standalone
		>	appginger consumes GinX
		>	so does simplifygnx
