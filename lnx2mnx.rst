LinX-to-MinX: A Grammar Driven Parser - Lexis-in-XML to Minimal-XML
===================================================================

* 	This section is intended to be the reference the lnx2mnx tool. 
	
*	Strictly speaking this tool is still in development and is not yet 
	scheduled for any particular release. But if you have a need for it
	then let us know, the current version is working and only lacks 
	documentation and a little polish.
	
*	This is a tool for intermediate to advanced programmers that is
	useful for converting LNX (the output of src2lnx) into MNX. The
	programmer writes the parser in a simple grammar using MNX
	syntax. 

	n.b. At some point in the future we may give MNX its own mini
	language that's more human friendly. But it is fairly simple to
	read at the moment.

* 	Readers of this section are likely to be trying to add a new
	front-end syntax to Ginger.
