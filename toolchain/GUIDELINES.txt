Documentation Guidelines for the Ginger Toolchain
=================================================

*	This section describes the principled design of the Ginger toolchain.

* 	The Reader is likely reading this to get an overview of how 
	- 	the tools fit together
	- 	their data interchange formats
	- 	how errors are handled
	- 	how they might configure the Ginger toolchain to inject their own tool
	- 	the rules their tool should obey
	- 	what they need to do to submit their tool for inclusion

* 	The individual tools are (currently) documented in their own sections.

* 	The individual file formats are (currently) documented standalone, too.
