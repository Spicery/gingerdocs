Documentation Guidelines for GSON and the GSON-to-GinX Converter
================================================================

* The Reader will read this
  - Trying to understand what GSON is (explained as JSON extension)
  - Trying to understand if they need it (unlikely, give motivation)
  - They have found a use for it and want to use it in their Ginger IDE.

* GSON is a DSL and therefore should be documented separately
  (possibly DSLs should be grouped)
  
* The GSON format should be documented here. 

* The tool for injecting GSON into the toolchain should be documented here.

* Because it is a DSL the format is the principal, not the tool.
