=======================================
The Ginger Programming Language Project
=======================================

Ginger is a programming language that is easy to learn, quick to get results and 
is suitable for a really wide range of projects - from the small, off-the-cuff scripts
to large scale team projects. We hope it will become your other programming language; 
the one you use when you want to have fun or really get things done; the one that no one 
has to pay you to use. 

*Ginger is still in development though, so maybe you would like to join in and 
help as a tester or a developer. We have a lot to do!*

The aim of the Ginger Project is not just to create the Ginger programming language 
but also its ecosystem of libraries, documentation and supporting tools.
