===============================
The Ginger Programming Language
===============================

Ginger is a programming language that is easy to learn, quick to get results and 
is suitable for both large team projects and small, off-the-cuff scripts.
We want it to be your other programming language; the one you use when you
want to have fun and really get things done; the one no one has to pay you to use. 

*Ginger is still in development though, so maybe you would like to join in and 
help as a tester or a developer. We have a lot to do!*

The aim of the Ginger Project is not just to create the Ginger programming language 
but also its ecosystem of libraries, documentation and supporting tools.
