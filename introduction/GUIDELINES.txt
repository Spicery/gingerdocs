Finally I added an 'introduction' top-level folder, for the various manifesto like bits I have written. After a bit I moved the loops.odt from advocacy into there. I see the 'introduction' as being the place where people figure out (1) what this is all about, (2) evaluate if they want to invest in this toolkit, (3) figure out how to get started. Advocacy comes into (2).
