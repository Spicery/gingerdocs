If One, Why Not Many?
---------------------

Another key rule is "if one, why not many?". This rule means that anywhere in the language where there is a restriction to one item, consider making it many items. So in Ginger expressions don't return just one value, they may return any number from 0, 1, ... and so on. And methods don't just dispatch on one special 'this' argument, they may dispatch on 0, 1, 2 ... of their arguments. In fact a function is just a special kind of method that dispatches on 0 arguments.
