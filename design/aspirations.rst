Aspirations of the  :mod:`Ginger` Project

Aspirations
===========

For part-time programmers and learners, we made :mod:`Ginger` a simple, clean 
and practical language that you can pick up quickly. The language features 
are properly separated, scrubbed of hard-to-learn corner cases, and 
mapped cleanly into syntax. And you can use the "Common" syntax which is
designed specifically for Ginger. But if you prefer to use a more familiar 
C-like syntax, that's well-supported too. This means that if you only use 
:mod:`Ginger` part-time, you're likely to find it easy to come back to despite 
the breaks. 

For professional programmers, we hope it will become your “other programming 
language”, the one you choose to program in for fun or when you're stretching 
yourself and doing something new. :mod:`Ginger` is  designed to be powerful 
enough for substantial professional programming projects. We have ensured that 
it works elegantly as a scripting language, yet can also be compiled reasonably 
well, permits rich type annotations and has an powerful package system. 

It also supports 'advanced' features such as first-class functions, 
coroutines, deferred evaluation, extensible pattern-matching,
transaction based exception handling, and DSLs - but expressed in
a clear and straightforward fashion. We hope you'll find :mod:`Ginger: inspires 
you to tackle challenging problems and find brilliantly direct and elegant 
solutions.
