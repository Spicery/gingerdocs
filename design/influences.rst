Influences
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

It's a pleasure to acknowledge at least some of the amazing languages and 
systems that have influenced us in the creation of Ginger. 

Pop11
=====
The way :mod:`Ginger` deals with multiple values is, we think, is what most 
programmers will find striking about the language. This is a refinement of
Pop11s 'open stack'. This AI programming language had a huge influence on the 
design of Ginger - coroutines, updaters and the design of the
flash compiler and autoloading all derive from Pop-11. The topic-based help 
is also strongly influenced by its IDE 'Poplog'.

Java
====
[Javadoc, the elimination of complex build scripts through class-to-file
mapping, the class library, class files and the JDK
]
We were blown away at the whole new level of design that Java brought to
the game - with a neat class system, tied into the organisation of projects
that made build scripts superfluous, a huge class library documented via
javadoc. 

Python3
=======
[Things to emphasize - how many of its values are shared with Ginger,
excellent basic types and clean syntax,
the excellent design of the library, is power as an integration tool,
and the way it has managed to evolve from its Python2 roots. Documentation
retained for introspection.]

Prolog
======
[Bring out how Prolog inspired the query language.]


And Many More ...
=================
Hopefully time will allow us to extend our appreciation to the many other
systems, like Lisp (esp Common Lisp/CLOS and Scheme), Smalltalk, FORTH and 
Standard ML, that have changed the way we think about programming. But for
hte moment, all we can say is a big thank you!
