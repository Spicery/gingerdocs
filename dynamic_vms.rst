Dynamically Create New Virtual Machines
=======================================
On the drawing board is the ability to create new virtual machines as a dynamic object that can be manipulated. The aim is to have all the power of reflection without any of the dirtiness. The programmer will be able to create new virtual machines (e.g. ``var vm = newVM()`` ), load code into them, run them at full speed, manage exceptions and even single step them (different virtual machines can use different interpreters).
