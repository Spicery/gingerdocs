Pattern Matching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another interesting part of the work is that we have designed the XML to elegantly support the concept of initialisation-as-pattern matching. In this approach, variable declarations turn out to be matches which evaluate to the first match and for-loops are iterators over all possible matches. It is rather pretty. [Status: designed, implementation in progress]
