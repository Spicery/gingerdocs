The -val- and -define- constructs already have their own rather limited pattern-matching capability which, for the purposes of these notes will be called structure matching.  It is natural to speculate whether these two notions of matching can be usefully integrated.  </p><p>We want to explore integration for two reasons.  Firstly, we want to create a small, uniform and coherent explanatory model for Spice.  Secondly, we know that programming with pattern-matching is a very powerful technique; one could reasonably argue it is a programming paradigm on a par with OOP or even logic programming.</p><p>To discuss these opportunities, CJD and SFKL met up at HP Labs on 24th October.  We had a wide ranging discussion that defies this reporter's ability to summarize it fully.  However, we began by reviewing the analogous structure of regular expressions and structure matching; we looked at the most obvious alterations to the interpretation of Spice syntax that might encompass the change; and we also examined the functional model that might be utilized to support first-class patterns.</p><p>These notes are not intended to be minutes.  Instead I have tried to organize the ideas into a story of escalating, hypothetical changes to Spice.  In doing so I have introduced a significant amount of new material.  As a result, these notes are intended to be part of the continuing debate rather than merely a summary.  The justification for this is that we ae still at an experimental phase and have not reached the stage of a definite proposal.</p><h2>[2] One-Way Pattern Matching</h2><h3>[2.1]Background: Structure Patterns and the Analogy with Regular Expressions</h3><p>Spice supports the following structure patterns when binding arguments, either as the argument of a -val- or the formal arguments of a function definition.  A structure pattern is used to match against zero, one or more actual values.</p><p>The structure patterns that are part of the core of Spice are shown below.  In addition, the analogy with regular expressions is illustrated in the right hand column.</p><pre>    Pattern ::=     _                       # //./            ::=     ...                     # //.*/            ::=     Id                      # //(.)/            ::=     Id ...                  # //(.*)/            ::=     Id : TypeExpr           # //(T)/            ::=     Pattern, Pattern        # //AB/            (with restriction)</pre><p>There is an extra restriction that only one vararg (... or Id...) argument can appear in a pattern.  This restriction was introduced in order to ensure unambiguous and efficient matching.  </p><h3>[2.2] Opening Up Structure Patterns</h3><p>The smallest hypothetical change we considered was :-</p><ol><li>To relax the single vararg restriction</li><li>To add literals</li></ol><pre>    Pattern ::=     Literal                 # //x/            ::=     _                       # //./            ::=     ...                     # //.*/            ::=     Id                      # //(.)/            ::=     Id...                   # //(.*)/            ::=     Id : TypeExpr           # //(T)/            ::=     Pattern, Pattern        # //AB/</pre>    <p>This apparently modest change means that there can be multiple bindings to a pattern.  For example,</p><pre>    val ( x..., y, z... ) = 'abc';</pre><p>Could bind as any of the following</p><pre>    x ==&gt; { 'ab' }, y ==&gt; 'c', z ==&gt; {}    x ==&gt; { 'a' }, y ==&gt; 'b', z ==&gt; { 'c' }    x ==&gt; {}, y ==&gt; 'a', z ==&gt; { 'bc' }</pre><p>The analogy with regular expressions suggests that it may be acceptable to impose an order on these solutions, by interpreting "..." as greedy or reluctant, and so make a choice.  Alternatively it may be more appropriate to only permit potentially ambiguous patterns in a context that iterates over all solutions - later on we see some examples of this.</p><p>Also, adding Literals to Patterns is not quite as innocuous as it might seem.  The complication is that a Literal might cause a match to fail.</p><pre>    val ( "foo", y ) = 'ab';    # Oh dear!</pre>    <p>However, it is arguably no worse that the run-time failure that can already result from a failure to result the correct number of results </p><pre>    val x = f();                # Not necessarily correct!</pre><h3>[2.3] TypePatterns</h3><p>The above small extension goes a long way towards establishing an intimate relationship between Patterns and Type Expressions.  We already have the following </p><pre>    TypeExpr            ::= Id                      # a primitive type            ::= TypeExpr, TypeExpr      # sequence            ::= TypeExpr ...            # star            ::= TypeExpr ??             # alternation with absent</pre><p>Given the rough similarity between the grammar of Pattern and that of TypeExpr the following question arises.  Should we attempt to unify Patterns, which include match variables, and Types which do not?  To explore this, we introduce a new syntactic category, TypePatterns.  The purpose of this is to let us to clearly distinguish the two different uses of identifiers in patterns.  An identifier in a Pattern is a match variable.  By contrast, an identifier in a TypePattern is a type variable.  We also carefully distinguish between TypePatterns that match against one value and those that match against many values.</p><pre>    Pattern ::=     Literal                     # //x/            ::=     _                           # Shorthand for Any            ::=     ...                         # Shorthand for Any...            ::=     Id                          # Shorthand for Id : Any            ::=     Id...                       # Shorthand for Id : Any...            ::=     Id : TypePattern            # Required match            ::=     Id :- TypePattern           # Dispatched match            ::=     Pattern, Pattern            # //AB/</pre>    <pre>    TypePattern            ::=     Literal                     # match values equal to the literal            ::=     _                           # Any            ::=     ...                         # AnyLots            ::=     TypeId                      # matches items of given type            ::=     TypePattern ...             # matches many items of given type            ::=     TypePattern, TypePattern    # concatenation of match patterns            ::=     TypePattern ??              # matches absent or the pattern            ::=     TypePattern | TypePattern   # alternation</pre>    <p>Firstly, note that TypePatterns allow alternation.  Because TypePatterns do not include match variables they are trivially dangle-free and so alternation is problem-free.  [Aside: a match variable is said to "dangle" if it is potentially accessible despite a failure to bind it.]</p><p>Secondly, note that there are two possible interpretations of "x : T".  In the same way that a method's formal parameter can be marked as dispatch or non-dispatch (required), so we can distinguish between the patterns "x :- T" and "x : T".  [Please note: we have not definitively agreed the spelling of dispatched and non-dispatched formal parameters.  We overturned an earlier design decision and have not filled in the details of spelling.]</p><p>To illustrate the difference between the two, consider these two examples</p><pre>    val ..., x : String, ... = ( 0, "oops" );           # generates a run-time error    val ..., x :- String, ... = ( 0, "ok" );            # binds x to "ok"</pre><p>In the first case, we find an invalid binding and check it post-hoc.  We don't like what we find and have to raise a run-time error.  In the second case, the match is guided to the unique valid binding and it succeeds.</p><p>As will be seen a little further below, the difference between ":" and ":-" is exactly what we need to "inline" methods as switch statements.</p><h3>[2.4] Equality Constraints on Patterns</h3><p>One concern that arises is how to match against the value of an existing (free) variable rather than merely introduce it.  CJD points out that the HPSL idiom 'Pattern = Expr' allows us to get exactly the effect needed.  We can use this to interpret a val/var declaration as a pattern match.</p><pre>    ValDeclaration ::= val Pattern</pre><p>When we write</p><pre>    val x = 3;</pre><p>we could choose to interpret this as a Pattern which introduces -x- and, incidentally, binds it to 3.  The elegance of this interpretation is compelling.</p><h3>[2.5] Unified Patterns</h3><p>Another worthwhile extension, borrowed from SML this time, is the idea of "chained" Patterns, so you can refer to the original value as well as its matched components.  In our case I have added one clause to the Pattern grammar</p><pre>    Pattern ::=     Pattern ~= Pattern</pre>    <p>The Pattern</p><pre>     A ~= B</pre><p>is one that only matches if _both_ A and B are matched against and all their bindings established.  Note that this is dangle-free.</p><p>For symmetry I add a parallel clause to the TypePattern grammar.</p><h3>[2.6] Going Further - Pattern Based Programming</h3><p>To make effective use of these Patterns, we have to be able to use them to control execution and also to find more than just the first match.  </p><p>Firstly, we want to execute code conditionally upon a match.  In this case the challenge is to avoid "dangling" match variables.  A spectacular example of a matcher that fails this criterion is the Pop11's matcher.  Experience with the Pop11 matcher shows us that it is important to restrict the scope of match variables to the context of a successful match.  [Aside: A possible alternative would be to define the values in the event of a failed match - which is the approach taken in traditional regular expression matching.]</p><p>The -switch- statement might be adapted for this purpose.  Inventing syntax ad hoc, we can imagine writing -match- instead of -case- to introduce a Pattern context :-</p><pre>    switch Expr    match Pattern then        Statements      # match variables of Pattern in scope here    endswitch   </pre><p>If there are multiple -match- clauses before the -then-, by analogy with -case- clauses, it is unclear what the scope of the match variables should be.  We would be in danger of dangling match variables.  Note that it is the absence of a Pattern alternation operator that has spared us from this consideration previously.  [Aside: the | and ?? operators in TypePatterns are alternations but because they can only appear in TypePatterns, which are free of bindings, they are dangle-free.]</p><p>The second use of Patterns that we would desire is the ability to iterate over some or all of the possible solutions.  Our first hypothetical step is to add a new type of loop expression such as :-</p><pre>    for Pattern matches Expression do Statements endfor</pre>    <p>The meaning would be that all the possible matches of the Pattern would be found in turn and the Statements executed with the appropriately bound match variables in scope.  </p><h3>[2.7] Loops as Query Iterators</h3><p>This idea naturally leads to an intriguing interpretation of all the loop expressions as Query iterators.  A good analogy is to be made with Prolog.  A Pattern plays the role of a Prolog term but a Query plays the role of a Prolog predicate.  In this interpretation, code fragments such as</p><pre>    i in my_list    j from 0 to 99</pre><p>would be interpreted as a Queries.  Their meaning is that the control Pattern is successively bound to the generated values.</p><p>Here's the ever-expanding grammar :-</p><pre>    Query   ::=     Pattern matches Expr            ::=     Pattern in Expr            ::=     Pattern on Expr            ::=     Pattern from Expr to Expr       # and all relevant variants</pre><p>By way of introduction to the idiom of programming with matches, note how the way -matches- can be exploited to achieve the effect of -in-.</p><pre>    for x in L do &lt;etc&gt;    for ..., x, ... matches L... do &lt;etc&gt;</pre>    <p>This gives rise to some neat shortcuts - or perhaps merely strange effects.  For example, we might choose to give an interpretation to the following loop.</p><pre>    for x, y in L &lt;etc&gt;</pre><p>as</p><pre>    for ..., x, y, ... matches L... do &lt;etc&gt;</pre>    <p>In other words, it finds all the adjacent element pairs in L.  We can vary this trick to get other useful results.  If we wanted all the pairs of distinct elements we might write</p><pre>    for x, ..., y in L do &lt;etc&gt;</pre><p>If we wanted to select the string elements from a list we might write this</p><pre>    { for x :- String in L do x endfor } </pre><p>Another idiom might be iterating over all the partitions of list</p><pre>    for lhs..., rhs... matches L... do &lt;etc&gt;</pre><h3>[2.8] Constructors and Destructors</h3><p>There has been a long-standing, tacit agreement that at some point we would attempt to integrate constructors into structure Patterns.  For example, it has always been our intention to arrange that</p><pre>    val { x, y } = { 'xy' };</pre><p>would have the same effect as</p><pre>    val x = 'x';  val y = 'y';</pre><p>Function-like application in Patterns is probably best treated as constructors and their destructors used during the matching process.  This obviously requires that destructors can inferred from constructors and that destructors are distinct from updaters.</p><p>Adding constructors into Patterns seem to add no complications.  The grammar expands quite a lot just because we want to match against constructors in both Patterns and TypePatterns.</p><pre>    Pattern ::=     Literal                     # //x/            ::=     _                           # Shorthand for Any            ::=     ...                         # Shorthand for Any...            ::=     Id                          # Shorthand for Id : Any            ::=     Id...                       # Shorthand for Id : Any...            ::=     Id : TypePattern            # Required match        } see below!            ::=     Id :- TypePattern           # Dispatched match      }            ::=     Pattern, Pattern            # //AB/            ::=     Pattern ~= Pattern            ::=     Construction    Construction             ::=     { Pattern }            ::=     Expr( Pattern )            ::=     Pattern . Expr            ::=     Pattern . Expr( Pattern )            ::=     Pattern @ Expr            ::=     Pattern @ Expr Pattern    TypePattern            ::=     Literal                     # match values equal to the literal            ::=     _                           # Any            ::=     ...                         # AnyLots            ::=     TypeId                      # matches items of given type            ::=     TypePattern ...             # matches many items of given type            ::=     TypePattern, TypePattern    # concatenation of match patterns            ::=     TypePattern ~= TypePattern            ::=     TypePattern ??              # matches absent or the pattern            ::=     TypeConstruction    TypeConstruction ::=            ::=     { TypePattern }             # matches a sequence of a given type            ::=     Expr( TypePattern )            ::=     TypePattern . Expr            ::=     TypePattern . Expr( TypePattern )            ::=     TypePattern @ Expr            ::=     TypePattern @ Expr TypePattern</pre>    <h3>[2.9] Side Conditions, Composite Queries and Repeated Match Variables</h3><p>Another easy-to-anticipate extension is the addition of side-conditions to Queries (or even Patterns).  Borrowing from HPSL again, we can extend our grammar with the clause</p><pre>    Query   ::= Query where Expr</pre><p>This enables us to write much more powerful queries, such as this palindrome finder, without any significant complications.</p><pre>    for i..., j... in L where i = j.rev and i.length &gt;= 2 do &lt;etc&gt;</pre><p>Further we might well want to consider the conjunction of two Queries A &amp; B.  Conjunction is dangle-free, of course, so it is safe to incorporate it as a Query operator.</p><pre>    Query   ::= Query &amp; Query</pre><p>This extension can be used for very modest effect such as the following compact declaration</p><pre>    val x = 1 &amp; y = 2;</pre>    <p>Alternatively, it can be exploited for powerful idioms.  Here is one such idiom for computing the shared elements of two lists</p><pre>    define function shared( A, B ) =&gt;        { for i in A &amp; _ = i in B do i endfor }    enddefine;</pre><p>Perhaps the above one-liner should have been written</p><pre>    { for i in A &amp; i in B do i endfor }     # i is repeated twice</pre><p>This becomes possible if we adopt the convention that repeated match variables are permitted and imply equality.  The only consideration is whether this extension would introduce difficult scope issues.  On the face of it there are none.</p><p>This also introduces this beautiful idiom for nested iteration</p><pre>    # This surprised me ...    for i in A &amp; j in B do &lt;etc&gt;</pre>    <h3>[2.10] Naked Queries</h3><p>Of course, we also want to make conditional switches on Queries as well as Patterns.  A key observation is that Queries can appear in expression context.  As a consequence the ordinary 'if' construct is adequate</p><pre>    if Query then &lt;etc&gt;</pre>    <p>The only question is whether or not the variables of the Query are in scope within the then-part of the 'if'.  I would argue that this is the most natural interpretation - but this topic is still slightly in flux.</p><p>Naked queries give rise to some very elegant one-liners.  Here is the code for list membership :-</p><pre>    # short and sweet, almost to the point of cruelty.    define function member( x, L ) =&gt; _ = x in L enddefine;</pre><h3>[2.11] Equivalent of Method Definitions and Switches</h3><p>This framework is now more than powerful enough to allow us to rewrite the methods of a generic function as a single switch statement.  [Aside: This satisfies another of our general background goals, to be able to rewrite methods into a simpler in-line construct.]  If we have the following definitions</p><pre>    define generic g( Pattern ) =&gt; Expr enddefine;    define method g( Pattern_1 ) =&gt; Expr_1 enddefine;    define method g( Pattern_2 ) =&gt; Expr_2 enddefine;</pre>    <p>we can rewrite this as</p><pre>    # We require the match clauses to be ordered by generality    define function g( args... ) =&gt;        switch args...        match Pattern then Expr         # actually checked last of all.        match Pattern_1 then Expr_1        match Pattern_2 then Expr_2        else throw &lt;etc&gt;        endswitch    enddefine;</pre><h3>[2.12] Summary: One-Way Unification</h3><p>All of the changes discussed make structural pattern matching a very powerful tool.  However, it is still only a one-way unification.  As such it does not allow the creation of shared variables (aliases).  Nor does it permit Patterns to be used as first-class objects; they are restricted to appearing in a few match contexts.</p><pre>    Query   ::=     Pattern matches Expr            ::=     Pattern in Expr            ::=     Pattern on Expr            ::=     Pattern from Expr to Expr   # and all relevant variants            ::=     Query where Expr            ::=     Query &amp; Query    Pattern ::=     Literal                     # //x/            ::=     _                           # Shorthand for Any            ::=     ...                         # Shorthand for Any...            ::=     Id                          # Shorthand for Id : Any            ::=     Id...                       # Shorthand for Id : Any...            ::=     Id : TypePattern            # Required match        } see below!            ::=     Id :- TypePattern           # Dispatched match      }            ::=     Pattern, Pattern            # //AB/            ::=     Pattern ~= Pattern            ::=     Construction    Construction             ::=     { Pattern }            ::=     Expr( Pattern )            ::=     Pattern .

A good baseline in this regard is set by Prolog, of course.  Pure Prolog eschews the -call- operator and that is not regarded as much of a problem.  This sounds a note of caution: be careful that the benefit of first-class patterns is big enough to justify the complications that they bring.</p><p>Complications start arising when we try to unify the concept of "backreferences", in regular expressions, with bound variables in Patterns.  Once Patterns are freed to roam as run-time values, we get dangling match variables back again.  Similarly, trying to accommodate alternation within structure patterns gives rise to the same issue.</p><p>After some experimentation with the functional model underpinning regular expressions, it became apparent that there was no compelling reason for integrating the "capture groups" of regular expressions with the match variables of structure patterns.  The basic problem is that regular expressions are declarative and therefore re-entrant but first-class structure patterns are doggedly imperative.</p><p>At the time of writing, it appears that we should aim for a model of regular expression arithmetic that encompasses structure patterns so that learning one contributes to learning both.</p><h2>[3.2] Regular Expression Arithmetic</h2><p>It has been another long-standing intention to add a dynamic pattern matching capability.  Again, the inclusion of regular expression literals acts as a spur to firm this up.  We have a rather loose "SNOBOL-like" functional model to act as the general model for matching.</p><pre>    matcher( con, alt, stringThingy ) -&gt; stringThingy</pre><p>This is an informal model since we have not agreed the types of con, alt and stringThingy.  Here are some examples showing how it might work out.</p><pre>    # Match 1-item    define function matchOne( con, alt, s ) =&gt;        if s.isEmptyStringThingy then            alt( s )        else            con( alt, allbutfirst( 1, s ) )        endif    enddefine;    # A or B    define function alt( A, B ) =&gt; ( con, alt, s ) =&gt;        A( con, B( con, alt, ? ), s )    enddefine;    # A then B    define function join( A, B ) =&gt; ( con, alt, s ) =&gt;        A( B( alt, ? ), alt, s )    enddefine;</pre></body></html>
