<h2 align="center">A comparision between ECMAScript 262 and
Spice</h2>

<p align="center"><small>Dave Raggett &lt;dsr@w3.org&gt;<br>
25th September 1998</small></p>

<p class="footnote">This version incorporates a number of syntax
changes inspired by discussions at ECMA. For instance, the use of
'class' rather than 'prototype' and the ability to use reserved
words as identifiers.</p>

<h3 align="center">Abstract</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Application developers frequently find the limitations of
HTML get in the way. Wouldn't it be nice if you could just add your
own tags and write a few lines of script to handle them? Well HP
has been busy developing a solution based upon a new way to combine
style sheets and scripting, building upon CSS and ECMAScript. The
result called "Spice" allows you to add new style properties and to
define or import support for new ways to render XML tags. This
paper suggests how to extend ECMAScript 262 to add style rules and
boost performance for flexible object-oriented scripting.</em></p>

<p><em>HP has submitted Spice to the World Wide Web Consortium,
see</em></p>

<h2>Style Rules</h2>

<p>Style rules are an addition to ECMAScript and necessitate the
introduction of "style" as a new reserved word. The application of
style rules to markup trees is handled through libraries. This
allows for different choices in how XML is parsed, e.g. do you keep
the entire parse tree or just the ancestor elements and immediately
preceding peers; do you apply style rules eagerly as tags are
parsed or do you wait until the parse tree has been fully
built?</p>

<p>Style rules conform to the definitions in the W3C CSS2
specification for the precedence of selectors and the cascading
mechanism for associating style properties with elements in the
markup parse tree. Note that you are not restricted to the
properties defined in CSS2, and are free to use others as
appropriate to new kinds of flow objects.</p>

<p>Style rules: style keyword followed by CSS2 selector and
property list:</p>

<pre>
style em { fontweight: italic; display: inline }
</pre>

<p>Style rules are sorted by specificity for the tag to which they
apply:</p>

<pre>
style p { fontfamily: "Times New Roman", serif; display: block }

style p.note { fontfamily: "MS Comic Sans", "sans-serif" }
</pre>

<p>As a result, p tags with the class "note" get the
properties:</p>

<pre>
   fontfamily: "MS Comic Sans", "sans-serif"
   display: block
</pre>

<p>while other p tags get the properties:</p>

<pre>
   fontfamily: "Times New Roman", serif;
   display: block
</pre>

<h3>Hyphenation</h3>

<p>CSS uses hyphens within style property names. This presents
problems in a scripting language as the hyphen will be confused
with the infix minus operator. As a result Spice doesn't allow you
to hyphenate property names.</p>

<p class="issue">What about hyphens in tag names and attribute
names? One idea would be allow hyphens when immediately preceded by
a backslash character, e.g. my\-tag which matches "my-tag".
Alternatively, you could use the hexadecimal Unicode character code
escape sequence as in my\u002Dtag. Note that a general escaping
mechanism is needed to cater for the liberal definition of namechar
in the XML 1.0 specification. This should perhaps apply to all
ECMAScript identifiers.</p>

<h2>Flow Objects</h2>

<p>The display property names the flow object class for formatting
the markup element the rule applies to. The above examples use
inline flow objects for em elements and block for p elements.</p>

<p>Flow objects are imported from libraries or written directly in
the scripting language. The process of applying the style rules to
a markup tree creates a corresponding hierarchy of flow
objects.</p>

<p>All flow objects must support a small set of methods:</p>

<pre>
   object.format(element);  // format markup element
   object.append(child);    // append flow object as child
</pre>

<p>Additional methods support rendering to a window, reformatting
upon changes, e.g. when the window is resized, and dispatching of
events.</p>

<p>Markup elements must support the properties:</p>

<pre>
   element.attributes;      // the set of attributes
   element.content;         // the element's content
   element.style;           // the element's style properties
</pre>

<p>Each attribute must support the properties:</p>

<pre>
   attribute.name;          // e.g. href
   attribute.value;         // e.g. monica.jpg
</pre>

<p>The format method allows the flow object to look at the elements
attributes and style properties to determine what styles to adopt.
The format method is called after the new flow object has been
appended to its parent flow object. This ensures that the flow
object can ask its parent flow object for inherited styles, for
example font size and family.</p>

<p>At the minimum, style property values can be parsed as a
sequence of lexical tokens, represented as text strings. For
greater efficiency you can represent property values as symbolic
expressions. Simple property values are identifiers such as <em>
bold</em> or <em>center</em> or string literals such as <em>"Times
New Roman"</em>. Compound property values may include both comma
and space separated items. You can also use operators like + and /
for expressions, and functions such as <em>rgb(128, 128,
255)</em>.</p>

<p>Spice defines a number of units such as "cm" for lengths, for
instance <em>12cm</em>. Other common units are "px" for pixels,
"pt" for points and "em" for em's where one em is the same length
as the current font height. Less common are "s" for seconds and
"Hz" for frequency. "%" is used for percentages, e.g. for
expressing the font size relative to that used by the parent flow
object.</p>

<h3>Units</h3>

<p>The common case is a number followed immediately by an
identifier indicating the units of measure, e.g.</p>

<pre>
12pt        // height in points
2.5cm       // distance in centimetres
3s          // time in seconds
1000Hz      // frequency in Hertz
120%        // 120 percent
</pre>

<p>To allow units to be used with variables, a different syntax is
appropriate to avoid syntactic ambiguities. For instance:</p>

<pre>
units(x, pt)    // x is in points
</pre>

<p>Spice allows you to declare units in terms of other units. In
some cases this allows the compiler to reduce expressions at
compile time. For some units such as the <em>em</em> (the height of
the current font) you don't know the conversion factor at compile
time. The meaning of the <em>%</em> unit also depends on the
context, e.g. the height of the parent font, or the distance
between the current left and right margins. The evaluation of
symbolic expressions involving units is carried out in the context
of an environment that provides the means to convert units. This
environment is set up by flow objects to contain the current
definition of 1pt, 1em and 100% etc. Note that the conversion of
lengths such as points and inches to pixels is not fixed and can be
adjusted to zoom the document's contents.</p>

<p>Units can be handled in a similar fashion to semicolon
omission. One way to think of this is as a filter between the
lexer and the parser. The filter inserts missing semicolons and
recognizes tokens acting as units of measure, labeling them as
postfix operators. This approach avoids the need to treat units
as reserved words, and leaves you free to use compiler generator
technologies such as yacc for the parser.</p>

<p>The % token is an interesting case as it also serves as the
remainder operator. The filter can use a simple rule to identify
whether a % token should be considered as the postfix percent
operator or as the infix remainder operator: Choose the infix role
when followed by a term that unambigously starts an expression,
otherwise chose the prefix role. By making % bind more tightly
than + the expression "10% + 3" is always interpreted as (10%) +
3. While in "10% (+3)" or "10 % 3" the % is interpreted as
remainder.</p>


<h2>Importing Flow Object Classes</h2>

<p>You will often want to use existing libraries of flow object
classes. Such libraries could be written in Java, or C++ or even in
ECMAScript. The import statement allows you to import named flow
objects.</p>

<p>Interoperability across vendors and platforms is crucial to the
Web as it greatly increases the number of people who can read each
document. This in turn encourages the creation of content, and
helps to explain why the Web has grown so dramatically.</p>

<p>Spice style sheets support interoperability by decoupling flow
objects from their implementations. A Spice library (aka <em>spice
rack</em>) names a set of flow objects with support for particular
style properties. Each library is identified by a URL.</p>

<p>Libraries are decoupled from their implementations. This makes
it practical to provide different implementations of a library for
each platform. Each flow object has a name such as "paragraph" that
is local in scope to the library in which it is defined. The <em>
import</em> statement is used to import flow objects from
libraries, e.g.</p>

<pre>
    import document, block, inline from "http://www.w3.org/Style/std.lib";
</pre>

<p>Here 'document' and 'inline' etc. are names of flow objects from
the (hypothetical) library identified by the URL
&lt;http://www.w3.org/Style/std.lib&gt;.</p>

<p>The <em>implements</em> statement is used to specify
implementations for particular libraries, e.g.</p>

<pre>
    "css.spice" implements "http://www.w3.org/Style/std.lib" on "Spice";
    "css.jar" implements "http://www.w3.org/Style/std.lib" on "Java";
    "css.cab" implements "http://www.w3.org/Style/std.lib" on "ActiveX/win32";
</pre>

<p>Here "css.jar" and "css.cab" are relative URLs, defined as
relative to the URL for the current style sheet. You can also use
absolute URLs. The <em>on</em> keyword precedes a string naming the
platform that this implementation applies to.</p>

<p>In the absence of a matching implements statement, the import
statement expects to get the implementation from the URL specified
by the <em>from</em> keyword. If that too is missing, you can
simply list the URLs for the files you want to import, for
instance:</p>

<pre>
    import "housestyle.css";    // imports a CSS style sheet
    import "koolbits.spice";    // imports a Spice style sheet
</pre>

<h2>Greater Performance</h2>

<p>As the scripting language becomes more powerful, its performance
will correspondingly become more important. Unfortunately,
ECMAScript 262 presents barriers to effective compilation:</p>

<h3>The difficulties</h3>

<ul>
<li>Objects are bound to a set of properties. This set can be
changed dynamically. The binding can be represented as a view from
objects to properties or as a view from properties to objects.
ECMAScript allows each property to be accessed by name or by
number. The numbers needn't be contiguous.</li>

<li>Accessing a named property of an object involves a lookup
process. The cost can be reduced by caching the result either with
the indexing mechanism on the heap, or as local pointers in
function definitions.</li>

<li>Properties may be inherited from prototypes, which may be
changed dynamically. This needs to be taken into account in
determining when the cache is invalid.</li>

<li>For function definitions, the compiler can allocate local
pointers to cache lookups for properties accessed within the
function definition . Code within loops can now use the local
pointer rather than the heavyweight lookup mechanism.</li>

<li>If the code includes a function call, the compiler can't be
sure that the local pointer remains valid after the call.
Unfortunately, this is a particularly common case. Threading would
also pose problems if two threads accessed the same property
concurrently.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A fresh approach</h3>

<p>Dramatic improvements in speed and memory needs can be achieved
by number of adjustments to the language semantics. The first step
is to provide an explicit syntax for declaring the properties and
methods of classes. For instance:</p>

<pre>
  class Warning extends block
  {
      method format(element)
      {
          this.style.borderStyle = solid;
          this.append(new Text("Warning!"));
          ProcessChildren(element, this);
      }
  }
</pre>

<p>The next step is to preclude the ability to change methods by
assigning a new method at run-time. This ensures that the compiler
can exploit a static dispatch mechanism. This limitation is not
unduely restrictive, as languages such as C++, SmallTalk and Java
demonstrate. In ECMAScript 262 you had to define class methods by
assigning functions to properties, but this need goes away with the
new syntax.</p>

<p>To allow efficient code to be generated for local variables, the
compiler wants to be able to allocate variables to known machine
registers or known positions on the stack frame. This becomes
possible if you can identify the scope of a variable statically.
This precludes the ECMAScript <em>with</em> statement, and the use
of <em>eval</em> with local variables. This is hard to work around
because you don't know whether or not a procedure you call invokes
these to look at this function's environment.</p>

<p>Yet another way to improve performance is to allow people to
provide optional type information, for instance to specify that a
given variable will always be a number. For large data structures,
knowing the types can dramatically reduce the time the garbage
collector spends tracing the heap.</p>

<p>ECMAScript 262 reserves a number of words for future use. Spice
takes advantage of these where appropriate, but needs to reserve a
few more, e.g. "style" and "method". To allow the language to grow
it should be possible to add to the set of reserved words in
revisions to the language. At the same time, older scripts in which
these words have been used as variables should continue to work.
How can this be arranged?</p>

<p>One idea is for names occurring in variable declarations or the
left hand side of assignments, or as class or function names to be
treated identifiers regardless of whether or not they are reserved
words. An exception is when the word has previously be used in its
intended role as a reserved word. This makes it practical to detect
typographical errors where an identifier has been mistyped so that
it clashes with a reserved word.</p>
