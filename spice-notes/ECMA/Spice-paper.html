<h2>1. Background</h2>

<h3>1.1. Introduction</h3>

<p>CSS[<a href="#r1">1</a>] has proved to be highly effective and
easy to learn for simple applications. Spice is designed to meet
the needs of more complex applications for richer style sheets that
offer capabilities such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The ability to layout documents using libraries of objects
and to extend them via scripting</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Flexible scripting of dynamic effects, including multimedia
presentations</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Generating multiple flow objects per markup element</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Processing elements out of the normal sequence</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Process the same elements more than once in different styles,
for instance, to generate a table of contents from headings</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Spice is an extended version of the ECMAScript language as
defined by ECMA 262[<a href="#r2">2</a>], more commonly known as
JavaScript[<a href="#r3">3</a>]. Spice is designed to make it
simple to apply style and behaviour to XML[<a href="#r4">4</a>]
documents, but can also be applied to HTML[<a href="#r5">5</a>].
Spice builds upon familiarity with CSS. It uses the same syntax for
representing style rules and allows you to cascade style
information, including imported CSS style sheets.</p>

<p>You are probably asking why not just use CSS? The answer is
simple: Spice gives you much greater flexibility in adding style
and behavior. Unlike CSS it doesn't make hardwired assumptions
about what things you can render. Instead these are defined by
downloadable flow objects that implement things like paragraphs,
text emphasis, hypertext links etc. To get you started, CSS flow
objects are made available as standard. When these aren't up to the
job, you can write your own flow objects in Spice, Java[<a href=
"#r6">6</a>] or ActiveX[<a href="#r7">7</a>].</p>

<p>If you want to add a few extensions to common style sheets and
flow objects, you can write a small style sheet for your extensions
and import the common definitions. When the latter are cached or
preloaded, only your extensions will need to be downloaded,
speeding document display.</p>

<h3>1.2. Relationship to DSSSL</h3>

<p>DSSSL[<a href="#r8">8</a>] is the Document Style Semantics and
Specification Language and is meant to work with SGML[<a href=
"#r9">9</a>], the Standard Generalized Markup Language. DSSSL was
developed by ISO over a period of many years. It is a very powerful
but hard to learn language for styling SGML documents. DSSSL
exploits the Scheme[<a href="#r10">10</a>] language to define rules
for traversing document markup to generate a sequence of flow
objects. DSSSL defines a large set of flow objects for printed
documents.</p>

<p>A DSSSL rule for an H1 element:</p>

<pre>
    (element H1
        (make paragraph
             font-family-name: "Times New Roman"
             font-weight: 'bold
             font-size: 20pt
             quadding: 'center))
</pre>

<p>By contrast the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) language is much
easier to learn. You specify simple rules that specify one or more
style properties such as font size, or color. Each rule has a <em>
selector</em> specifying a pattern for matching to elements in the
document markup.</p>

<p>A CSS rule for an H1 element:</p>

<pre>
    H1 {
        font-family: "Times New Roman";
        font-weight: bold;
        font-style: italic;
        font-size: 20pt;
        text-align: center;
    }
</pre>

<p>A powerful feature in CSS is the ability to cascade rules
defined in different style sheets. This makes it easy to extend
existing style sheets by importing them and adding one or two new
rules. It also allows you to split up your style rules to take
advantage of the ability to inherit style properties from enclosing
elements.</p>

<p>Here H1 elements will inherit the font family from the rule for
the enclosing BODY element.</p>

<pre>
    BODY {
        font-family: "Times New Roman";
        font-size: 12pt;
        text-align: left;
    }

    H1 {
        font-size: 20pt;
        font-weight: bold;
        text-align: center;
    }        
</pre>

<h3>1.3. So what is Spice?</h3>

<p>Spice is an amalgam of ideas from DSSSL, CSS and JavaScript.
JavaScript is a popular scripting language for Web pages. Spice
extends JavaScript to add cascading style rules using the same
syntax as CSS. The rules further name the flow object class to be
used to format each element.</p>

<p>Flow objects can be written in Spice or imported from classes
implemented in Java or as ActiveX controls. Each flow object has a
format method that is used to format its contents. The method is
passed an element in the document markup, the style properties
specified by the cascading style rules and the current flow.</p>

<p>You can use flow objects to generate additional flow objects,
for example for list bullets or generated text for warnings. You
can generate alternate flows for different media, such as for
speech synthesis, or for alternative presentations, such as a table
of contents generated from the document headings. Flow objects can
exploit the full capabilities of the W3C Document Object Model[<a
href="#r11">11</a>] for traversing the document markup.</p>

<p>To further control the behaviour, you can write event handlers
to script flow objects, whether or not these are implemented in
Spice or in Java, etc. This gives you the ability to dynamically
alter the document after it has been loaded.</p>

<h3>1.4. Comparison with XSL</h3>

<p>XSL[<a href="#r12">12</a>] is a proposal for a style sheet
langage defined in XML. It uses an entirely new syntax for style
rules and flow object constructors. By contrast, Spice uses CSS
syntax for style rules and properties, leveraging people's
investment in CSS. A detailed comparison between Spice and XSL is
given in [<a href="#r13">13</a>].</p>

<h2>2. Style Rules and Flow Objects</h2>

<h3>2.1. Introduction to Style Rules</h3>

<p>Style rules are used to assign style properties to each element
in the document. Here is a rule that could be used for an HTML P
element:</p>

<pre>
    style p
    {
        fontSize: 12pt;
        display: block
    }
</pre>

<p>This rule specifies two properties: <em>fontSize</em> and <em>
display</em>. The latter names a flow object to be used to format
the element and can be defined in Spice or Java or even as an
ActiveX control.</p>

<p>The display property is used to name a flow object that can be
used to format "p" elements. The value "none" is reserved for the
cases where you want to suppress the formatting of an element and
its descendants, e.g. to suppress an element called "answer":</p>

<pre>
    style answer
    {
        display: none
    }
</pre>

<p>If necessary, you can change the name of the property used to
name the flow object. This feature is mainly relevant when
rendering to other media, for which the term "display" is
inappropriate.</p>

<p>Flow objects are used for formatting different parts of a
document and generally consist of things like blocks, list items,
inline emphasis, tables etc. Properties like fontSize are passed to
flow objects to control the formatting.</p>

<p>The <em>import</em> statement can be used to import style sheets
which then form part of the cascade. More details on this statement
are given in a later section. You can even import CSS style
sheets:</p>

<pre>
    import "funstyle.css";
</pre>

<p>Unlike CSS, Spice doesn't allow the use of hyphens within
property names. This avoids confusion with the infix operator for
minus. When CSS style sheets are imported into Spice, a name like
<em>font-style</em> is automatically mapped to <em>
fontStyle</em>.</p>

<p>Another difference is to avoid problems with white space. You
must use '*' when you want a selector to match any element. For
instance:</p>

<pre>
    *[href]
</pre>

<p>matches any element with an attribute "href". Apart from this,
the selector syntax is the same as for CSS2[<a href="#r14">14</a>].
For example:</p>

<pre>
style ul p
{
    fontFamily: "Comic Sans MS"
}
</pre>

<p>Matches all P elements that are descendants of a UL element.</p>

<h3>2.2. Spice Tutorial</h3>

<p>Spice makes it simple to create style sheets for documents. A
small subset of HTML is used below to illustrate this. (<em>adapted
from Paul Prescod's DSSSL tutorial[<a href="#r15">15</a>]</em>)</p>

<p><b>Small but complete document and DTD</b></p>

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE tinyhtml [
&lt;!ELEMENT tinyhtml - - (h1|p)* &gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT (h1|p) - - (#PCDATA|em|strong)* &gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT (em|strong) - - (#PCDATA)&gt; ]&gt;

&lt;tinyhtml&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;bold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;outrageous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/tinyhtml&gt;
</pre>

<p><b>The corresponding stylesheet</b></p>

<pre>
import document, block, inline;

style tinyhtml
{
    fontFamily: "Arial";
    fontSize: 12pt;
    display: document
}

style h1
{
    fontWeight: bold;
    fontSize: 1.5em;
    textAlign: center;
    display: block
}

style p
{
    textAlign: left;
    display: block
}

style em
{
    fontStyle: italic;
    display: inline
}

style strong
{
    fontWeight: bold;
    display: inline
}
</pre>

<p>This style sheet uses three kinds of flow objects: document,
block and inline. These are imported from external definitions.
This example uses standard flow objects defined for use with CSS,
but you can also import flow objects from code written in Spice,
Java or ActiveX. H1 and P elements are formatted using CSS <em>
block</em>s. These are inserted in sequence into the document flow
object created for the toplevel HTMLLITE element. In a similar
manner the <em>inline</em> flow objects for EM and STRONG elements
are inserted into the blocks used for the parent elements.</p>

<p>Style properties are passed to flow objects to control the
formatting. Property values are symbolic expressions whose
evaluation is left to flow objects to deal with. Simple property
values are identifiers such as <em>bold</em> or <em>center</em> or
string literals such as <em>"Times New Roman"</em>. Compound
property values may include both comma and space separated items.
You can also use operators like + and / for expressions, and
functions such as <em>rgb(128, 128, 255)</em>.</p>

<p>Spice defines a number of units such as "cm" for lengths, for
instance <em>12cm</em>. Other common units are "px" for pixels,
"pt" for points and "em" for em's where one em is the same length
as the current font height. Less common are "s" for seconds and
"Hz" for frequency. "%" is used for percentages, e.g. for
expressing the font size relative to that used by the parent flow
object.</p>

<h3>2.3. Inheritance</h3>

<p>Flow objects inherit style properties from their parent flow
object. This allows the font family to be specified once at the top
level. The font size for H1 elements is set to 1.5em, which is
twice the height of the current font size, as specified for the
parent flow object. This yields a font size of 18pt. P elements are
rendered in the font size for the document flow object, i.e. 12pt.
The same goes for the flow objects for emphasis that are used to
flow EM and STRONG elements.</p>

<!--
<p>Note: uninitialized identifiers such as bold and center are
treated as a kind of symbolic value. They can be tested for
equality and assigned to variables, but throw an undefined
exception in other expressions, for instance, if you try to compare
them to numbers. This is an extension to the set of primitive types
defined in ECMA 262.</p>
-->

<h3>2.4. Definitions and Expressions</h3>

<p>Let's expand the HTML subset to include several levels of
headings. We could simply paste copies of the H1 rule and modify
that, but to allow the styles of all headings to be changed in a
single place, we can use shared definitions for property values as
follows:</p>

<pre>
headingFont = "Times New Roman";
headingWeight = bold;
headingPosture = italic;

style h1
{
    fontFamily: headingFont;
    fontWeight: headingWeight;
    fontStyle: headingPosture;
    fontSize: 1.5em;
    textAlign: center;
    display: block
}

style h2
{
    fontFamily: headingFont;
    fontWeight: headingWeight;
    fontStyle: headingPosture;
    fontSize: 1.2em;
    textAlign: left;
    display: block
}
</pre>

<p>Property values can include expressions, for instance to compute
the font size:</p>

<pre>
headingFontSize = 20pt;

style h2
{
    fontFamily: headingFont;
    fontWeight: headingWeight;
    fontStyle: headingPosture;
    fontSize: 0.7 * headingFontSize;
    textAlign: left;
    display: block
}
</pre>

<h3>2.5. Taking control with custom flows</h3>

<p>By default, each element is formatted by a single flow object
which is inserted in sequence into its parent flow object. This
works well when the structure of the flow objects mirrors the
structure of the elements in the markup.</p>

<p>Spice allows you to override the default processing by creating
new classes of flow objects. These can be defined in Java or in
Spice itself. A simple example is to insert some leading text for
an element serving as a warning:</p>

<p>Spice allows you to define flow objects with the full power of a
scripting language. The following example defines a new flow object
derived from the standard flow object <em>block</em>. It creates a
block with a solid border and inserts the text string "Warning!" in
the start of its contents:</p>

<pre>
    class Warning extends block
    {
        method format(element)
        {
            this.style.borderStyle = solid;
            this.append(new Text("Warning!"));
            ProcessChildren(element, this);
        }
    }

    style warning
    {
        fontSize: 14pt;
        display: Warning
    }
</pre>

<p>Flow objects form a directed acyclic graph. The "flow" property
specifies the parent flow, while the "children" property specifies
the sequence of flow objects acting as children. The "format"
method is passed the element in the document parse tree that the
flow object is being applied to. The "append" method is used to
append a new child to the sequence of children.</p>

<p>ProcessChildren is a built-in method that iterates through the
children of an element in the document parse tree, creating the
flow objects named by their display properties and appending them
to the current flow. It is defined as follows:</p>

<pre>
    function ProcessChildren(element, flow)
    {
        var child, subflow;

        for (child in element.children)
        {
            if (child.display != null)
            {
                subflow = new child.display;
                flow.append(subflow);
                subflow.element = child;
                subflow.format(element);
            }
            else // assume node is Text
            {
                flow.append(child);
            }
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>This is the definition of the default methods for appending a
child to a parent flow, and for formatting it.</p>

<pre>
    function Flow_append(node)
    {
        var size = this.children.length;
        this.children[size] = node;
        node.flow = this;
    }

    function Flow_format(element)
    {
        ProcessChildren(element, this);
    }
</pre>

<p>The default behaviour maps each element to a single flow object
according to the <em>display</em> property then invokes that
object's format method. This is repeated for each of the element's
children.</p>

<h3>2.6. Out of Sequence Processing</h3>

<p>Normally the flow objects are generated in the same sequence as
the elements in the document. On occasion, there is the need to do
process something out of sequence.</p>

<p>An example is the aural rendering of table cells. HTML 4.0
provides the means to associate each cell with one or more header
cells. In the simplest case, you render the pertinent headers
before the contents of each data cell.</p>

<p>The first step is to use the <em>headers</em> attribute on the
data cell to get the list of ID values for each of the headers. The
next is to iterate through the list, getting each header in turn
and processing it in the context of the current flow. Finally, the
content of the current element is processed:</p>

<pre>
    var hdrefs = GetAttribute(element, "headers");

    for (hdref in hdrefs)
    {
        header = GetElementByID(element, hdref);
        ProcessChildren(header, this);      
    }
 
    ProcessChildren(element, this);
</pre>

<p>Other functions allow you to traverse the document markup tree
using the full capabilities of the document object model defined by
W3C.</p>

<p>A more sophistocated approach is to process the headers in a
different mode. Modes are explained in the next section.</p>

<h3>2.7. Using modes for alternate renderings</h3>

<p>Suppose you want to construct a table of contents for the
document that is to appear in a side panel. The table of contents
might consist of the headings from all of the sections in the
document. If you use the style rules for the main part of the
document, the headings will appear too large in the table of
contents.</p>

<p>The solution is to define a new set of rules within a mode
declaration.</p>

<pre>
    mode toc
    {
        style *
        {
            display: none
        }

        style h1
        {
            level: 1
            display: toc_entry
        }

        style h2
        {
            level: 2
            display: toc_entry
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>In the format method for a flow object, you can then direct
subsequent processing to use style rules for this mode using the
<em>with mode</em> construct, as for example:</p>

<pre>
    with mode toc
    {
        ProcessChildren(element, toc);
    }
</pre>

<p>The contents of the element are then processed using style rules
defined for the mode "toc". Note that style rules cascade
independently for each mode.</p>

<p>If you don't need to define you own flow objects, you can use
the <em>with mode</em> directive in style rules to specify the mode
to be used to process a named flow object, e.g.</p>

<pre>
    style #toc
    {
        display: block with mode toc
    }
</pre>

<p>You can specify that an element is to be processed in several
modes as follows:</p>

<pre>
    style body
    {
        display: block with mode toc, block with mode regular
    }
</pre>

<p>The default mode is named <em>regular</em>.</p>

<p><em>Note: an open question is whether mode definitions can be
nested. Another is whether to replace"with mode" by
"using".</em></p>

<h3>2.8. Media dependent style sheets</h3>

<p>Suppose you want to write a style sheet that will render some
parts of a document to a display and other parts to a speech
synthesiser. The <em>media</em> declaration allows you to specify
which media a group of rules can be used for:</p>

<pre>
    media aural
    {
        style body
        {
            volume: medium;
            voiceFamily: male;
            speak: normal
        }

        style abbr
        {
            volume: medium;
            voiceFamily: female;
            speak: spellOut
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>You can then direct subsequent processing to use style rules for
this media using the <em>with media</em> construct, as for
example:</p>

<pre>
    with media aural
    {
        ProcessChildren(element, tape);
    }
</pre>

<p>The contents of the element are then processed using style rules
defined for the media "aural". A comma separated list of media can
be given following the <em>media</em> keyword.</p>

<h3>2.9. Flow Objects, Events and Graphics</h3>

<p>Spice introduces some short cuts for defining protoypes, which
are ECMAScript's version of the object classes used in regular
object oriented programming languages. This together with a few
other features allows Spice to be compiled efficiently. Here is
an example of a new class extending an imported class "block":</p>

<pre>
    class Warning extends block
    {
        method format(element)
        {
            this.style.borderStyle = solid;
            this.append(new Text("Warning!"));
            ProcessChildren(element, this);
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>This example is roughly equivalent to:</p>

<pre>
        function Warning()
        {
            this.name = "Warning";
            this.flow = null;
            this.children = new Array;
        }

        function Warning_layout(element)
        {
            this.style.borderStyle = solid;
            this.append(new Text("Warning!"));
            ProcessChildren(element, this);
        }

        new Warning;  // make sure prototype is created
        Warning.prototype.append = block.prototype.append;
        Warning.prototype.layout = Warning_layout;
</pre>

<p>Prototypes make it easy to define event handlers using the <em>
when</em> statement:</p>

<pre>
    class Link extends inline
    {
        slot href = "http://www.w3.org/";

        ...

        when onmousedown
        {
            document.load(this.href);
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>This defines a flow object prototype for hypertext links,
derived from the prototype for emphasis. Clicking on a link causes
it to load the URL given in its href property. You can use the
prototype construct to extend flow objects defined in other
languages. This allows you to specify event handlers for such
objects.</p>

<p>The addition of a standard graphics library would allow flow
objects to be written in Spice that render themselves as text and
graphics. For instance exploiting graphical effects for decorating
text, something that is currently solved using bitmapped graphics.
Flow objects written in Java can exploit AWT for this purpose.</p>

<h3>2.10. Libraries</h3>

<p>Interoperability across vendors and platforms is crucial to the
Web as it greatly increases the number of people who can read each
document. This in turn encourages the creation of content, and
helps to explain why the Web has grown so dramatically.</p>

<p>Spice style sheets support interoperability by decoupling flow
objects from their implementations. A Spice library (aka <em>spice
rack</em>) names a set of flow objects with support for particular
style properties. Each library is identified by a URL.</p>

<p>Libraries are decoupled from their implementations. This makes
it practical to provide different implementations of a library for
each platform. Each flow object has a name such as "paragraph" that
is local in scope to the library in which it is defined. The <em>
import</em> statement is used to import flow objects from
libraries, e.g.</p>

<pre>
    import document, block, inline from "http://www.w3.org/Style/std.lib";
</pre>

<p>Here 'document' and 'inline' etc. are names of flow objects from
the (hypothetical) library identified by the URL
&lt;http://www.w3.org/Style/std.lib&gt;.</p>

<p>The <em>implements</em> statement is used to specify
implementations for particular libraries, e.g.</p>

<pre>
    "css.spice" implements "http://www.w3.org/Style/std.lib" on "Spice";
    "css.jar" implements "http://www.w3.org/Style/std.lib" on "Java";
    "css.cab" implements "http://www.w3.org/Style/std.lib" on "ActiveX/win32";
</pre>

<p>Here "css.jar" and "css.cab" are relative URLs, defined as
relative to the URL for the current style sheet. You can also use
absolute URLs. The <em>on</em> keyword precedes a string naming the
platform that this implementation applies to.</p>

<p>In the absence of a matching implements statement, the import
statement expects to get the implementation from the URL specified
by the <em>from</em> keyword. If that too is missing, you can
simply list the URLs for the files you want to import, for
instance:</p>

<pre>
    import "housestyle.css";    // imports a CSS style sheet
    import "koolbits.spice";    // imports a Spice style sheet
</pre>

<h3>2.11. How to specify the style sheet</h3>

<p>If the user asks the browser for mydoc.xml, this is downloaded
and parsed to build a tree-like representation of the markup. The
Spice script specifying the style can be specified using the accepted
XML convention. For instance:/p>

<pre>
  &lt;?xml-stylesheet href="docstyle.spice" type="text/spice" ?&gt;
</pre>

<p>In an HTML document you can use the LINK element, e.g.</p>

<pre>
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/spice" href="docstyle.spice"&gt;
</pre>

<p>The document is formatted starting with the element that is the
root of the tree. The first step is to find matching style rules
for the root element. Style rules cascade in the same way as for
CSS. Spice uses the CSS2 definitions for the precedence of matching
style rules. The display property names the flow object to be used
to lay out the root element, and in turn its children. The process
collects the matching styles for each element, creates a flow
object to lay it out, and so on until the whole of the document has
been layed out.</p>
