<h1>Evolving ECMAScript into Spice -- a rationale</h1>

<h1><a name="here1"></a> 1 introduction</h1>

<p>This document presents some of the ways in which the current
definition of Spice differs from ECMAScript 262 and justifies them
in terms of the goals that Spice was designed to satisfy. Further
changes are likely as work proceeds on merging ECMAScript and
Spice.</p>

<p>We attempt to show how these changes can be viewed as
evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, steps.</p>

<p>In reading this be prepared for syntax like:</p>

<pre>
  for ... do ... endfor

  while ... do ... endwhile

  switch ... case ... endswitch
</pre>

<p>rather than the more familiar "C" style syntax:</p>

<pre>
  for (...)
   { ... }

  while ( ... )
   { ... }

  switch ( ... )
   { ... }
</pre>

<p>The new syntax makes it easier for programmers to ensure that
control constructs are correctly nested. However, Spice also
supports the "C" style syntax for people who don't want to
change.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>aside</i>. While this document refers throughout to "the
[Spice] compiler", this is not meant to preclude an interpreted
implementation. The reader should regard compilation as simply the
steps required to prepare Spice source for execution, including a
variety of checks for legality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Existing ECMAScript programs cannot be blindly treated as Spice
code; they will need conversion. While mechanical translation is
possible (and we advise that tools to do this be created and made
available) the full benefits of Spice can only be obtained by
rewriting code to exploit its new features.</p>

<h1><a name="here2"></a> 2 Spice goals</h1>

<p>Spice has several more-or-less consistent goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>declarative support for style-sheets, including support for
units; style-sheets attach properties (name-value mappings) to XML
tree nodes specified by patterns.</li>

<li>compilable to native code with speed "comparable" to other
languages with similar power, say no more than 8 times slower than
C on code directly expressible in C, and preferably much faster, at
least as fast as compiled Lisp; when declarations are present,
access to elements of data-structures should reduce to a few
machine instructions (preferably one).</li>

<li>space performance comparable to C++ or Lisp, ie simple objects
occupy only a few words; adding a new slot to a structure should
increase its size by little more than the space needed for that
slot.</li>

<li>scalable to large (but not enormous) scripts, hence adding
support for modularisation, encapsulation, and abstraction, and
making it easy to do after-the-fact modifications (eg allowing the
moral equivalent of "adding new methods to an existing
class").</li>

<li>avoiding "gotchas" such as silent creation of variables on
assignments (even if those variables are referred to nowhere else,
because they're actually mis-spellings).</li>

<li>access to code written in other languages should not be
difficult (although this issue is not addressed in this
document).</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="here3"></a> 3 style sheets</h1>

<p>Style sheets are the original reason for Spice existing. They
provide a declarative mechanism for attaching rendering properties
to markup and are used to control how XML tags are mapped to flow
objects. Such objects are things like paragraphs that know how to
flow their text within given margins, images, form fields and
tables etc. Objects can also be interfaces to instruments, or
databases etc. You can import flow objects from libraries and you
can write a few lines of script to extend imported flow
objects. This makes Spice very attractive for building Web-based
applications using XML.</p>

<p>A style declaration specifies the <i>style properties</i> to be
attached to a node in an XML tree that satisfies a <i>node
selector</i>. A node in an XML tree has a <i>tag</i> (in HTML
terms, the part that says <strong>h1</strong> or <strong>p</strong>
or <strong>table</strong>) and some <i>attributes</i>. A style
declaration looks like</p>

<pre><b>
  style <em>selector</em>
  {
     <em>name</em>: <em>value</em> ;
     <em>name</em>: <em>value</em> ;
     ...
     <em>name</em>: <em>value</em> ;
  }
</b></pre>

<p>The selector defines a pattern that can be used to check whether
the style rule matches a given node in the markup tree. The syntax
and semantics is that defined by W3C's CSS2 specification. See: <a
href=
"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2</a></p>

<p>Selectors match tag names and can place constraints on
attribute values, ancestor elements, and immediately preceding
peer elements. This allows style rules to be applied progressively
as the markup is received over the network, without the need to
wait until the full markup tree has been parsed. There is no need
to keep the complete markup tree in memory.</p>

<p>The body of the style rule contains one or more named
property values. These values are used by flow objects to control
formatting and to handle events such as rendering requests. This
places a premium on efficient access to style values. You don't
want to waste time in a paint method!</p>

<p>To allow flow objects to interpret style property values
efficiently, we would like to represent them as symbolic
expressions rather than as character strings. These expressions
are evaluated at run-time using an environment that provides
the appropriate context, for instance, defining "100% " as
the current font height or as the distance between the current
left and right margins.</p>

<p>Spice doesn't limit style rules to the properties defined by
CSS. You can use additional properties as appropriate to the
flow objects you wish to use in your application.</p>

<p>The mechanism for applying the rules to markup trees starts
with the root node of the markup tree. The <em>display</em>
property is used to identify the name of a flow object class. An
instance of this class is created and its format method called to
format the markup tree. In many cases, the markup tree and the
flow object hierarchy are isomorphic, i.e. each node in the markup
tree corresponds to a different flow object. However, you are
not restricted to this.</p>

<h2><a name="here4"></a> 3.1 units</h2>

<p>Spice allows values to have units attached. This is most obvious
in the syntax of numeric literals, where the units can be directly
attached: <strong>44cm</strong> and <strong>10px</strong> are both
legal Spice values.</p>

<p>A unit has an associated <strong>dimension</strong> (eg <strong>
mass</strong>, <strong>length</strong>, <strong>time</strong>) and
<strong>scale</strong> (either <strong>absent</strong> or a number
and another unit). Values with units can be added and subtracted if
they have the same dimensions (otherwise an exception is thrown).
Values with units can be multiplied and divided.</p>

<p>If the scale of a unit is <strong>absent</strong>, then adding
it to a dimensionally-compatible value will generate a symbolic
expression, rather than a simple unit value.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>aside</i>. This is required so that stylesheets can contain
property bindings such as <strong>width: 1cm + 2px</strong>, where
<strong>px</strong> and <strong>cm</strong> are both lengths but
the scaling is not known until the rendering object has access to
the size of pixels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spice also has <strong>percentage</strong> values, generated by
the postfix operator <strong>%</strong>; these also generate
symbolic expressions when added to values with units.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>aside</i>. There is an issue with the use of <strong>
%</strong> as both the legacy remainder operator and as the
percentage operator. Abolishing <strong>%</strong> as remainder
(replacing it with <strong>rem</strong> or <strong>mod</strong>) is
the cleanest solution, but may fail on legacy issues. A possible
hack is to recognise the special cases of <strong>%</strong>
followed by an expression starter (treat it as <strong>
rem</strong>) or not (treat it as <strong>percent</strong>), but
this fails with the current stylesheet grammar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The procedure <strong>resolve(u, c)</strong>, where <strong>
u</strong> is a value with units and <strong>c</strong> is a
context giving scaling factors for the unscaled units of <strong>
u</strong>, delivers a single value with units calculated using the
scaling factors and taking account of any percentages.</p>

<h3><a name="here5"></a> 3.1.1 historical note</h3>

<p>There have been several attempts in the past to define
programming languages with support for units, yet current popular
languages don't have it. Why is this?</p>

<p>We suspect it is a combination of several factors. First, such
languages tried to do all the unit resolution at compile-time,
representing the values internally as plain numbers. This makes it
hard to write generic procedures operating on values with units (as
similarly happened to Pascal's arrays before the various extensions
for formal array parameters became common).</p>

<p>Second, the same obsession with reducing unit arithmetic to
machine arithmetic meant that representations which involved store
allocation (as ours can do) were not considered.</p>

<p>Third, while it is "nice" to be able to operate with units in
scientific and engineering programs, careful commenting and
explicit scaling will often serve; there simply wasn't the user
pressure. However, stylesheet arithmetic needs to be able to
manipulate values (such as <strong>4px + 20%</strong>) which <i>
cannot</i> be represented as plain numbers; once the machinery is
in place to support those, the rest of the unit implementation
comes cheaply.</p>

<p>If implementations of Spice pay careful attention to the
efficient implementation of "small" values in a well-chosen set of
units, much of the space (and some of the time) overhead can be
saved.</p>

<h1><a name="here6"></a> 4 scaling</h1>

<p>As scripts get larger, it becomes increasingly important to
avoid trivial mistakes (eg those due to misspellings) and to
introduce ways in whioch a script can be broken cleanly into
(reusable) components.</p>

<h2><a name="here7"></a> 4.1 modules</h2>

<p>Spice introduces a simple module system. This allows a script to
be made up of multiple separate (reusable) components and provides
the primary encapsulation mechanism. The Spice module system should
present no problems (apart from new reserved words) to ECMAScript
programmers.</p>

<p>All declarations can be marked <strong>public</strong> or
<strong>private</strong>, with <strong>private</strong> being the
default. A <strong>private</strong> name is simply not accessible
outside its defining module.</p>

<p>Modules are named with a dot-separated sequence of identifiers.
Spice does not require there to be any close relationship between
the name of a module, the name of a file that may contain it, and
the names of any directories that that file may be in; in
particular, it is explicitly expected that modules with widely
differing names be accessible from within a single directory.</p>

<p>Full module names only appear in <strong>module</strong> and
<strong>import</strong> declarations. Normally a module will import
other modules "in full": their <strong>public</strong> names are
visible to the importing module without qualification. However, a
module may be imported <i>qualified</i>, in which case an
identifier <strong>x</strong> within an imported module eg <strong>
alpha.beta.gamma</strong> is referred to as <strong>
gamma::x</strong>; only the last component (the <i>leafname</i>) of
the module name is used to qualify identifiers. Where there is
ambiguity of leafnames, a module may be imported qualified with a
new leafname.</p>

<p>This means that module names do not appear scattered through a
module's body, that where they do appear they are not ridiculously
long, and that name conflicts can be easily resolved.</p>

<h2><a name="here8"></a> 4.2 avoiding gotchas: declarations</h2>

<p>Implicit declarations (such as are found in many scripting
languages) render them susceptible to spelling mistakes. Spice
requires declarations.</p>

<h3><a name="here9"></a> 4.2.1 variable declarations</h3>

<p>Spice requires that all variables be declared; this avoids
misspelling gotchas. The cost to the script-writer is insignificant
(at worst the insertion of a <strong>var Name</strong> definition
earlier in the procedure or top-level code).</p>

<p>As a recovery action, the Spice compiler can automatically
declare undeclared identifiers as top-level variables. Whether or
not a warning message is generated in browsers could be a matter
for user preference settings.</p>

<h3><a name="here10"></a> 4.2.2 typed identifiers and results</h3>

<p>To make code easier to understand for the human reader, and to
give the compiler more opportunity to check and optimise code,
Spice allows variables, arguments, and procedure results to be
typed.</p>

<p>For example, the declarations <strong>var x = 3 is Int</strong>
and <strong>var y: String = "z"</strong> type their new
identifiers. Only values of the specified types can be assigned to
those variables. An untyped variable is implicitly typed <strong>
Any</strong>, and can hold any [single] value whatsoever.</p>

<p>Arguments can be typed, as in <strong>function f( x: Int )
...</strong>, where <strong>x</strong> is required to be an
<strong>Int</strong> value. (This permits overloading; see later.)
The result of a function can be typed, as in <strong>function f()
returns Int ...</strong></p>

<h2><a name="here11"></a> 4.3 closing-keyword syntax</h2>

<p>As a general rule, Spice allows most C-style control constructs
to appear in an alternative <i>closing-keyword</i> form, and does
the same with its new constructs. For example, the C-style</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>if</strong> (E) yes(); <strong>else</strong> no();</p>
</blockquote>

<p>can be written instead as</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>if</strong> E <strong>then</strong> yes() <strong>
else</strong> no() <strong>endif</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The advantages of this are that compiler error reporting is
better, and that adding (or removing) statements from the then or
else arms does not involve adding (or removing) braces.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>aside</i>. Additionally it reduces the religious wars about
where such braces should be written.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also it is easier to see the end of a construct, because it is
automatically tagged in a way that matches the beginning (making it
reduntant to attach explanatory comments to closing braces, as is
sometimes seen in C code).</p>

<h1><a name="here12"></a> 5 expressive power</h1>

<p>"Expressive power" means, roughly, that its easy for the
programmer to write code that does common things, and that there
are ways of re-using code that lets you "think big thoughts".</p>

<h2><a name="here13"></a> 5.1 array expressions</h2>

<p>Spice has an explicit <i>array expression</i>; <strong>
[E<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>2</sub>, ..., E<sub>n</sub>]</strong>
evaluates to an array whose first component is the value of
<strong>E<sub>1</sub></strong> and so on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>aside</i>. The description above takes no account of multiple
values.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="here14"></a> 5.2 procedure expressions</h2>

<p>It is very useful to be able to write a procedure-valued
expression without having to define a named function, usually
remote from the place where it is used. Spice borrows from other
languages the notion of a <i>lambda expression</i>; the form
<strong>(args =&gt; expression)</strong>, where <strong>
args</strong> is a sequence of arguments as seen in a procedure
declaration, represents an anonymous procedure with arguments
<strong>args</strong> and body <strong>expression</strong>.</p>

<p>Spice lambda expressions can refer to, and update, variables in
scope where the lambda expression was written; Spice has full
lexical scope.</p>

<p>Spice has a further shorthand for lambda expressions where the
body is a procedure call or operator expression where the operands
are the arguments to the lambda; those operands may be replaced by
<i>holes</i>, written <strong>_</strong> possibly followed by an
integer, and the lambda-arguments (and arrow) dropped.</p>

<p>Thus <strong>_ + 1</strong> is shorthand for <strong>(x =&gt; x
+ 1)</strong> [where <strong>x</strong> can be any fresh
identifier].</p>

<h2><a name="here15"></a> 5.3 multiple values</h2>

<p>Spice introduces expressions with <i>multiple values</i>. The
principal reason for this is to allow procedure calls to deliver
multiple results (thus avoiding the need for reference parameters
and equivalent hacks).</p>

<p>Multiple values are generated by the comma operator; <strong>
x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub></strong> represents the collection of
values consisting of all the values from <strong>
x<sub>1</sub></strong> followed by all the values from <strong>
x<sub>2</sub></strong>. This is how the arguments to a procedure
call are collected; as a multiple value formed from the argument
expressions.</p>

<p>A procedure call (or the execution of an operator) consumes <i>
all</i> the multiple argument values; "extra" ones do not escape.
The procedure (or operator) checks that the right number of
arguments have been supplied, and raises an exception if not.</p>

<p>An assignment may involve multiple values, in which case the
target(s) of the assignment must consume exactly as many values as
are provided by the source expression. Thus <strong>
(x,y)=(1,2)</strong> assigns <strong>1</strong> to <strong>
x</strong> and <strong>2</strong> to <strong>y</strong>, and all of
<strong>(x,y)=1</strong> and <strong>x=(1,2)</strong> and <strong>
(x,y)=(1,2,3)</strong> are illegal.</p>

<p>The source expression is evaluated first, and then the
assignments are done right-to-left. Thus <strong>
(x,y)=(y,x)</strong> will exchange the values of <strong>x</strong>
and <strong>y</strong>.</p>

<p>A declaration may also accept multiple values: eg <strong>var
(x, y) = (1, 2)</strong> declares <strong>x</strong> and <strong>
y</strong>, and assigns <strong>1</strong> to <strong>x</strong>
and <strong>2</strong> to <strong>y</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>implementation aside</i>. We intend that Spice multiple
values can be implemented using a single value stack, plus local
copies of the top-of-stack pointer or stack depth counter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Loops (see section 5.5) may deliver multiple values from their
<strong> break</strong> and <strong>with result</strong> clauses.
In addition, if the <strong>do</strong> is followed by the
reserved word <strong>all</strong>, all the results from the loop
body contribute to the result of the loop. Thus</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>for</strong> i <strong>from</strong> 1 <strong>
to</strong> 10 <strong>do all</strong> i <strong>
endfor</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>delivers ten values, the integers from <strong>1</strong> to
<strong>10</strong>. This is particularly useful for array
construction, where the entire array value may be built all in one
go, rather than allocating an array so big and then initialising
its elements one-by-one.</p>

<h3><a name="here16"></a> 5.3.1 controlling multiple values</h3>

<p>The expression <strong>one E</strong> evaluates <strong>
E</strong> and picks the first of its values, throwing away the
rest; if <strong>E</strong> delivers no values, <strong>
one</strong> delivers the special value <strong>
absent</strong>.</p>

<p>The expression <strong>none</strong> delivers no values, and the
expression <strong>none E</strong> evaluates <strong>E</strong> but
discards all its values.</p>

<h2><a name="here17"></a> 5.4 loops and switches are
expressions</h2>

<p>In Spice loops (and <strong>switch</strong>es, and <strong>
if</strong>s) are expressions which return values. The result from
a <strong>switch</strong> or <strong>if</strong> is the result from
the arm that is executed. The result from a loop is given by a
value attached to the <strong>break</strong> that it executes, if
any, and otherwise by the expression in a <strong>with
result</strong> clause. This is convenient for searches.</p>

<p>In a statement sequence <strong>S<sub>1</sub>;
S<sub>2</sub></strong> any results from <strong>
S<sub>1</sub></strong> are discarded.</p>

<h2><a name="here18"></a> 5.5 loops</h2>

<p>Spice has additional loop structures to those in ECMA 262.</p>

<p>The easy addition is the <strong>until</strong> loop, which is
just a <strong>while</strong> loop with the test inverted; it is
available simply to help loops read better.</p>

<p>The more complex addition is a general (and powerful) <strong>
for</strong> loop syntax which allows several different collections
of values to be iterated over at the same time, and without the
programmer having to write explicit stepping code.</p>

<p>The <strong>for</strong> loop introduces a set of <strong>
bindings</strong> which specify that a variable (thereby declared,
local to the loop, and immutable) take on the values from some
collection in turn until one of the collections is exhausted or
until a <strong>break</strong> is executed or a <strong>
while</strong> or <strong>until</strong> terminates the loop. For
example</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>for</strong> ch <strong>in</strong> "alphabetical":
String <strong>do</strong> ... ch ... <strong>endfor</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>will bind <strong>ch</strong> to successive elements of <strong>
"alphabetical"</strong> in turn. The <strong>:String</strong>
informs the compiler (and the human reader) that this is a <strong>
String</strong> iteration (which is obvious when it's a string
literal) and allows the compiler to generate efficient string
access code. (In particular, it does not need to do bounds-checking
on each access to an element of the string.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>for</strong> i <strong>from</strong> 1, ch <strong>
in</strong> s: String <strong>with result</strong> absent <strong>
do</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>if</strong> ch == lookFor <strong>then break</strong> i
<strong>endif</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>endfor</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This binds <strong>i</strong> to the integers from <strong>
1</strong> upwards, and <strong>ch</strong> to successive elements
of the string <strong>s</strong>. If one of those elements is equal
to <strong>lookFor</strong> then the loop terminates delivering the
appropriate value of <strong>i</strong>; otherwise it terminates
delivering <strong>absent</strong>.</p>

<p>Note again that the compiler can use unchecked access to the
elements of <strong>s</strong> and lightly-checked arithmetic to
increment <strong>i</strong>, because both identifiers are under
its control and the type of the iteration is tightly
constrained.</p>

<p>This multiple-iteration approach, combined with loops as
expressions and multiple values, makes many searches
straightforward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>aside</i>. The iteration techniques for a given type may be
known by the compiler as special cases, or may be part of the
specification for the types that may appear after the colon; this
protocol is not yet fixed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="here19"></a> 5.6 switches</h2>

<p>Spice allows <strong>switch</strong> expressions. The value
switched on may be any Spice value; it is not restricted to small
integers. In particular, switching on <strong>String</strong>
values allows simple table lookups to be done conveniently in-line
(for example, decoding a small command set from an input
string).</p>

<p>The case clauses in a Spice switch body are not as free and easy
as those of C (to reduce gotchas). Each clause consists of a
non-zero number of <strong>case E:</strong> prefixes, followed by a
statement sequence. The statement sequence is terminated by the
next clause, or by a <strong>default:</strong>. The expression
<strong>E</strong> is not required to be a compile-time constant,
and may deliver multiple values.</p>

<p>When the <strong>switch</strong> expression is executed, the
switched value is evaluated and reduced to a single value as for
<strong>one E</strong>. If there is a compile-time constant case
label equal (as tested by <strong>==</strong>, which is structural
equivalence) to this value, the corresponding statement sequence is
executed. Otherwise, the run-time case labels are tested for
equality with the switched value, and the first matching one gets
its statement sequence executed. If no labels match, the <strong>
default</strong> is executed; if there isn't one, it is as though
<strong>default: none</strong> had been supplied.</p>

<p>This allows the traditional <strong>switch</strong> on integer
values, and a less traditional switch on <strong>String</strong>
values. Spice compilers are expected to do better for <strong>
String</strong> case labels than a simple linear search (for
example, by hashing the constant labels and doing a preliminary
hash-test on the switched value).</p>

<h2><a name="here20"></a> 5.7 enumerations</h2>

<p>Many programs call for a small set of named values,
distinguished from all other values, to be used as handy labels for
states -- eg the labels on nodes of a parse tree, or of display
types. Languages without these <i>enumeration values</i> typically
have to imitate them with constant named integers, which loses all
type-safety.</p>

<p>Spice has a shorthand enumeration declaration</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>define enum</strong> EName <strong>=</strong>
Name<sub>1</sub>, ..., Name<sub>n</sub> <strong>
enddefine</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>to define enumeration values. <strong>EName</strong> is made the
name of a new class type (see elsewhere), with the <strong>
Name<sub>i</sub></strong> being constants bound to instances of
that type. Each instance has an associated <i>index</i>, which is
<strong>i</strong> for <strong>Name<sub>i</sub></strong>, and a <i>
name</i>, with is the obvious name.</p>

<p>Because enumerations are simply shorthand for classes, no new
linguistic machinery is needed to handle them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>aside</i>. However, implementors are encouraged to use a
concise immediate representation for enumeration values.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1><a name="here21"></a> 6 taming properties: classes, methods,
slots, and overloading</h1>

<p>The property mechanism of ECMAScript is a neat general-purpose
mechanism which allows values to be associated with arbitrarily
many named slots of objects. Unfortunately it suffers from serious
scalability defects.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>speed</strong>: in general, the expression <strong>
x.f</strong> (equally, <strong>x["f"]</strong>) must be executed
via a table lookup. This is enormously inefficient for things like
access to instance variables or methods.</li>

<li><strong>space</strong>: the space overhead for general lookup
tables is large; against the 1-word plus static overhead for a slot
in a language such as C++ or Java, the lookup table has more of the
order of 4 words (key, value, next-in-chain, tag on data type),
plus the per-instance overhead of having a table at all.</li>

<li><strong>gotchas</strong>: misspellings of properties silently
update new slots, or silently access default values; neither the
compiler nor the run-time support can offer much assistance.</li>
</ul>

<p>While speed and space concerns might be addressed by clever
implementations, we feel that it is better to have explicit
language constructs that the compiler can optimise freely.</p>

<h2><a name="here22"></a> 6.1 property declarations</h2>

<p>To address gotchas, Spice requires that properties be declared
explicitly, using the syntax <strong>property <i>Name</i> = <i>
Value</i></strong>. For "standard" properties, either that are
implicitly declared by the language, or they are imported using the
module system (see elsewhere).</p>

<p>However, Spice replaces many of the uses of properties by method
and slot declarations in classes.</p>

<h2><a name="here23"></a> 6.2 class declarations</h2>

<p>The notion of <strong>prototypes</strong> in ECMAScript, where
they appear only as dynamic values with no compile-time syntax, is
replaced in Spice by <strong>classes</strong> and <strong>class
definitions</strong>.</p>

<p>The present ECMAScript approach to methods-on-objects relies on
(a) the inheritance of properties from prototypes and (b) the
assignment of functions into (typically prototype) properties;
Spice replaces these with <i>method</i> and <i>slot</i> [instance
variable, data member] declarations.</p>

<p>A class definition defines a new class object with a specified
name, and says what slots objects of that class have. Each class
has an associated <i>prototypical object</i>. All objects have a
(fixed) associated class, which is returned by <strong>
typeof</strong>, and the names of classes are legal type names for
variable and argument declaration.</p>

<h3><a name="here24"></a> 6.2.1 method definitions</h3>

<p>The typical ECMAScript code for setting up methods is replaced
by Spice definitions and actions as show in the table.</p>

<p>The principal differences are that the definition of the method
replaces a function definition and an assignment, and that the
method is accessed simply by name rather than as a property; the
calling syntax remains the same.</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>define class</strong> Example<br>

<blockquote>
<strong>define method</strong> show() { print( this ) }<br>
</blockquote>

<strong>enddefine</strong>
</blockquote>

<p>On in the traditional style of syntax:</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>class</strong> Example<br>
{<br>

<blockquote>
<strong>method</strong> show()<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print( this );<br>
}<br>
</blockquote>

}
</blockquote>

<p><strong>method</strong> seems preferable to
<strong>function</strong> here, to make it clear that this is a
method definition rather than a function.</p>

<h3><a name="here25"></a> 6.2.2 slot definitions</h3>

<p>Just as <strong>method</strong> definitions both define what
happens when a method is called and attach that definition to the
class, <strong>slot</strong> definitions define slots of a class
and provide access to those slots.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>define class</strong> Example2</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>slot</strong> x</p>

<p><strong>slot</strong> y: Int</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>enddefine</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instances of <strong>Example2</strong> have two slots, <strong>
x</strong> and <strong>y</strong>; <strong>y</strong> is required
to be of type <strong>Int</strong>.</p>

<p>If <strong>E</strong> is an instance of <strong>
Example2</strong>, then <strong>E.x</strong> gets the value of
<strong>E</strong>'s x-slot and <strong>E.y</strong> gets the value
of <strong>E</strong>'s y-slot.</p>

<blockquote>aside: the use of <strong>slot</strong> rather than
<strong>var</strong> is intended to make it more obvious that
the declaration is that of a object property. If you want to
share the value of a slot with all instances of a class, you
can mark it as <strong>shared</strong>.</blockquote>

<h2><a name="here26"></a> 6.3 uniform reference</h2>

<p>Many programming languages [eg Java, C++] that espouse
object-orientation, because it supports isolating the details of
representation from the use of a type, still distinguish between
access to the value of a slot of a data-structure and calling a
function bound to that data-structure.</p>

<p>Spice does not do this. The syntax <strong>x.f</strong> is a
call to the procedure <strong>f</strong> with argument <strong>
x</strong>. The syntax <strong>x.f(A)</strong> is a call to the
procedure <strong>f</strong> with arguments <strong>(x,A)</strong>.
[And thus <strong>x.f</strong> and <strong>x.f()</strong> are
equivalent.] Slot declarations cause procedures to be generated for
each slot; in <strong>Example2</strong>, <strong>x</strong> and
<strong>y</strong> are both defined as methods which extract the
appropriate slots from instances of <strong>Example2</strong>.</p>

<p>This uniform approach to methods/functions/slots means that a
developer is free to change how an attribute of an object is
implemented; it may be extracted with a monadic method or it may be
a slot -- the calling syntax is the same. Further, methods are
"just" functions with an implicit <strong>this</strong>
argument.</p>

<p>Further, it is not just functions that are callable -- other
object classes are callable, too, in particular properties; hence
<strong>x.p</strong>, where <strong>p</strong> is a property, will
"call" <strong>p</strong> (which in turn will do a property lookup
for <strong>x</strong>).</p>

<h3><a name="here27"></a> 6.3.1 updaters</h3>

<p>Spice's uniform reference would be worthless if it prohibited
slots to be updated; how do we preserve the notation <strong>x.p =
E</strong> to assign the value of <strong>E</strong> to <strong>
x</strong>'s <strong>p</strong>-slot or property?</p>

<p>Every procedure may have an <i>updater</i>. When a procedure
call appears as the target of an assignment, it is its updater that
is invoked. Every <strong>slot</strong> procedure has an updater
that does the obvious thing. User-defined procedures may also be
given updaters (by declaring them with special syntax).</p>

<h3><a name="here28"></a> 6.3.2 overloading</h3>

<p>If two classes both define slots called <strong>thing</strong>,
what happens?</p>

<p>Clearly it's not good enough to declare one of the classes the
"winner" and forget the other definition for <strong>
thing</strong>; we'd like to allow <strong>x.thing</strong> to
extract the appropriate value from <strong>x</strong>, whichever
class it is.</p>

<p>Spice permits procedures to be <i>overloaded</i>, that is, to
have multiple definitions with different argument types. If an
overloaded procedure is called, the "most closely matching"
definition is invoked.</p>

<p>Slot and method definitions are overloaded on their first
(implicit) argument. Thus different classes may have slots and
methods with the same name without interference.</p>

<p>Procedures may be overloaded on <i>any</i> of their arguments,
not just or only the first. This means that script writers do not
have to write multiple-dispatch code "by hand" when required (ie,
implement the so-called "visitor pattern"); Spice overloading
subsumes this.</p>

<p>Spice does not limit overloading to methods defined in classes;
any function definition can be overloaded. Thus there is no
artificial line between "methods in a class" and "functions outside
a class".</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>aside</i>. Spice overloading is dynamic, not static, although
if the compiler can optimise away the method dispatch it may. Thus
an overloaded method can be passed as a parameter and used on
objects of different type within the called procedure -- unlike,
say, C++ and Java.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="here29"></a> 6.3.3 dynamic method definition</h3>

<p>Spice does not presently have a mechanism for dynamic method
definition (whereas present ECMAScript has <i>only</i> that).</p>

<p>If the syntactic approach that Spice uses is inadequate in
practice for scripting, then additional procedure-call syntax can
be added to give similar effects.</p>
