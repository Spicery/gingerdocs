So far so good.

There are several pre-flights activities:

    (1) Calculating section numbers - and attaching them somewhere
    (2) Constructing the contents table
    (3) Constructing the all-syntax list
    (4) Constructing the all-issues list <-- superfluous ??

Since the contents table depends on having a list/tree/mapping from
section numbers/identifiers to titles, it would seem like a good
idea to try to compute section numbers first.

What the hell is going on in bar.txt?  The \syntax\$ seems to be generating
nonsense.

*   The | value has been dropped

*   Strange <code></code> values are being inserted.

My current focus is on meaning.p

*   ChildStrength has been defined procedurally but I think this
    is probably be a mistake.  The repair procedure needs to know
    whether or not to attempt to introduce a paragraph.  This means
    that the Kernel should state whether the children must be
        1.  strong
        2.  weak
        3.  non_meaning
        4.  disallowed
