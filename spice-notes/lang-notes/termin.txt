Yes, I added termin to zest. I don't think it's *used* for anything at present,
though. I'd go for repeaters-then-termin myself.

Hi Chris,

I'm revisiting the issue of repeaters & -termin-.  Although I quite like the idea that an exhausted stream uses -termin- to signal its exhaustion, I've always worried that this prevents it from representing streams which include -termin-.  (If all you are worried about are character repeaters that's not a problem but the idea of a repeater is more general.)

It occurs to me that it possible to signal exhaustion in both ways: by returning the sentinel -termin- value _and_ also by changing state to end-of-stream.  In this case, procedures would not naturally be repeaters.  Instead there would be a constructor
	new Repeater: Procedure -> Repeater
that would simply look for termin and react with a change of state.

Any thoughts?
