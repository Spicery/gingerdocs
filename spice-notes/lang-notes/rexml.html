<h1>Recursive, Embedded XML</h1>

<p>
The key challenges in REXML are :-
</p>


<ol>

<li>
To cope with the fact that the lexical elements of XML,
    especially "&lt;" and "&gt;", clash rather unfortunately with the
    familiar less-than and greater-than operators.  It
    transpires that there is <em>just</em> enough leeway to have both
    the conventional comparison operators <em>and</em> the XML
    elements.
</li>
<li>
That XML character data has to be lexically distinguished
    from program text in some systematic way.  After quite a lot
    of experimentation, it became clear that the "clever"
    options didn't work well in practice.  Instead, I now
    recommend identifying character data with ordinary
    (Unicode) strings.
</li>

<li>
We need to be able to work with XML fragments as "object"
    values.  This is in stark contrast to many other approaches
    that simply print their output as they go along.  By
    constructing fragments as objects, we create the option of
    further processing them.

    This is an absolutely key idea as it leads to an alternative
    way of doing stylesheets.  Instead of stylesheets we use
    functions that transform fragments.  As a simple example,
    we might write a function that gives a table a blue
    background with rounded corners.

<pre>
# We abstract out this frequently used fragment.
const blue = &lt;td bgcolor="#0000FF"&gt;"&nbsp;"&lt;/td&gt;;

# Similarly, we might as we abstract this one.  Note that
# we are allowed to write name=variable to define the src
# attribute.  Note that "=&gt;" is just a mark separating function
# header from function body.
define tdimg( source ) =&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=source/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
enddefine

# To create a table with rounded edges, we wrap an enclosing
# 3x3 table with custom GIFs for the 4 corners and a coloured
# space for the 4 edges.  To do this properly, we ought to
# copy the alignment attributes of the inner table into the
# outr one.
define rounded( table ) =&gt;
	&lt;table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			tdimg( "bluetopleft.gif" ),
			blue,
			tdimg( "bluetopright.gif" )
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			blue,
			table.add_attribute( "bgcolor", c ),
			blue
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			tdimg( "bluebottomleft.gif" ),
			blue,
			tdimg( "bluebottomright.gif" )
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
enddefine
</pre>
</li>

<li>
It is essential to be able to denote expressions that
    evaluate to multiple values.  For example, to create
    a table of square roots one would like to write

<pre>
&lt;table&gt;
	for i from 1 to n do
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt; i &lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt; sqrt( i ) &lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	endfor
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre>

    Given that this returns an object, as we established above,
    it follows that the loop returns many values - n, in fact.
    Although this is unfamiliar to most programmers, it
    fortunately presents no difficulties in a dynamically
    typed language.
