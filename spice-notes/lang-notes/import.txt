Re: Import

The general form of an import looks like this

	import [qualified] [ NICKNAME = ] PKGNAME [ facet FACETS ] [ into FACET ]
	where 
		NICKNAME is a simple name
		PKGNAME is a compound name (may include dots)
		FACETS is a comma-separated sequence of facet names
		FACET is a simple name

A qualified import means that references to imported identifiers must use
an explicit nickname.  (n.b. Chris Dollin prefers to use the phrase 
"alias" to nickname.)  

To import "into" a facet means that the imported identifiers become part of
that facet.  As a trivial consequence, those identifiers may not be shadowed.
More important is the fact that this can be used to join together several
subsidary packages into a single master package.  e.g.

	package org.openspice.master_package;
	import org.openspice.subpackage1 into public;
	import org.openspice.subpackage2 into public;
	import org.openspice.subpackage3 into public;

A pervasive import is one which cannot be shadowed, although the imports are
not actually included into the facets.  I haven't got a record of
the agreed syntax for pervasive imports.  I expect that it looks like this:

	pervasive import ....

Importing "into" is the replacement for "public imports".
