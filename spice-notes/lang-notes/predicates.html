<h1>Palantir Memo: On Predicates</h1>

<p>
Q: How can you determine the extent of a predicate?
</p>


<p>
A: That's why we need the predicate "application" braces :-
	append( ?x, ?y, ?z ) :- ...
</p>

<hr>


<p>
Q: Can we use Prolog-style upper case variables?
</p>


<p>
A: No.  We sometimes need both "?x" and "x" in the same lexical scope.  Using "X" and "x" would be poor design.
</p>

<hr>


<p>
Q: Why don't we need "?x" variables when writing pattern-matching code such as
</p>
<pre>
	let Pair( x, y ) := E in B
</pre>

<p>
A: Insisting on a "?" prefix would be more general.  However, this is a 1-way unification and the extra generality makes it error prone.  Hence we have a simplified and more convenient approach for argument passing and let bindings.
</p>

<p>
n.b. 1-way unification uses ":=" or "&lt;-".  2-way uses "=".
