<h1>Design Notes for Spice Engine</h1>

<h2>Tree Representation</h2>

<p>
The parse tree itself does not encode restrictions such as One/None/Bool
and so on.  It limits itself to describing the structure of the input.
</p>

<p>
Therefore it is the responsibility of the code-planting routine to
correctly impose the right limitations.
</p>



<h2>Data Representation</h2>

<p>
On the whole Spice types map nicely into Pop11 types.  However the exception
is absent.  In Pop11, the role of absent is sometimes taken by undef or and
undef value, sometimes by 0 or 1, but mostly by false.  Since true and false
are better reserved for booleans, we have a problem.  I have decided to
resolve this in favour of the value of the Pop11 psuedo-variable _.
</p>

<p>
Spice lists are currently represented as Pop11 lists.  This is obviously
not a particularly satisfactory situation.  We'll get back to this.
</p>

<h2>Function Representation</h2>

<h3>Ordinary Functions</h3>

<p>
Spice function objects are currently represented as procedures - probably.
This may well not be correct.  In fact I tend to suspect this is wrong and
I should rely on compiler optimisations to make it practical to represent
Spice functions as a special kind of record.
</p>

<p>However, a Spice function is a Pop11 procedure that expects an
counted set of arguments.  There is currently no provision for eliminating
the count.
</p>

<h3>Updaters</h3>

<p>A Spice updater is a Pop11 procedure with doubly-counted arguments.
The double-count is supplied in a rather unexpected form.  The transformation
is shown below.
</p>

<pre>
    <i>E</i> -> <i>F</i>( <i>A</i> )

    <b>E</b> ; <b>A</b>; <b>#A</b> ; <b>#E</b>; updater( <b>F</b> )()
</pre>

<h3>Methods</h3>


<h2>Type Restrictions : Contextual and Asserted</h2>

<p>
There are several kind of contextual type restrictions in Spice.  Firstly,
there are many contexts where exactly zero or exactly one result is
required.  Secondly, all conditional contexts (such as if-expressions and
while-loops) require single boolean results.  Thirdly, function calls
require function values - non-functions need not apply!
</p>

<p>It is important that these contextual type restrictions are almost
always optimized away.  The main problem in this regard is function
calls.  Without type inference, the results of function calls cannot
be usefully typed and runtime code must be planted to enforce the
restrictions.
</p>

<p>
In addition to this, there are explicit type assertions introduced
by the programmer.  Again it is highly desirable that these type
restrictions improve performance - and that means exploiting type
information.
</p>


<h2>Consts in Library Mode</h2>

<p>Code can be compiled either of two modes: development or library mode.
This mode is very important from the viewpoint of efficiency.
</p>

<p>
Library mode prevents the recompilation of a package <em>and</em> requires
all imported packages were compiled in library mode.  This means that
a const declaration in a library is immutable for the lifetime of the
virtual machine.  [Note the careful phrasing - Palantir allows the
running of many virtual machines in parallel.]  This means that a
reference to a library const can be replaced by its value.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, a const declaration that is compiled in development
mode is merely protected against re-assignment, not re-compilation.
</p>

<p>Library mode makes type inference worthwhile.  If one can infer
the input and output type of a function, it is typically possible
to eliminate all the contextual checks and the redundant checks
associated with type assertions.
