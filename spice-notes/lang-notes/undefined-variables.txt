Re: 	Undefined Variables

I believe we allow
	var x;
to introduce -x- initially bound to -absent- (i.e. the default instance of
class Any).  

Do we allow
	var x...;
and if so, what is its initial value?

At the moment, JSpice does permit it and initializes it with an empty List.

I'm quite flexible on this topic.  I would be quite happy to forbid
the use of "val x" and "val x..." (except as the target of an assignment)
without an initial value.  That would sidestep some awkward observations 
that our constituency of occasional programmers might find themselves 
asking.

  IF  (val x := 99) gives zero results
  WHY DOESN'T (val x) give one result?

The answer to the above question is, of course, that (val x) is just
a shorthand for (val x = <default>) but it is not a very "Spicy"
answer.  It is not Spicy because it means inventing invisible expressions
that are different from the empty expression.

Yes. With some discomfort ...

I implement it as setting x to "undefined", but that looks like a cop-out. I'm
strongly tempted to simply disallow uninitialised declarations completely.
(-> val x counts as initialised). I might be prepared to make an exception
for "var x". Not allowing uninitialised declarations does away with all the
"default value" machinery.
