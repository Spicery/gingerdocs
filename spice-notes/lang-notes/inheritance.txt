Non-Standard Concepts

--- Symmetric Multiple Inheritance ---------------------------------

When a class inherits from multiple super-classes, no preference is
made between the super-classes.  To support this it may necessary for
the programmer to resolve potential ambiguities when writing methods.


--- Royalty --------------------------------------------------------

A class may only extend one royal class directly or indirectly. 
Equally, a class may not be a descendant of two royal classes.  The
point of royal classes is to allow the compiler to plant slightly more
efficient code for method accesses.

However, it isn't clear to me that there is any point in royalty.  It
is perfectly possible to detect "potentially" royal classes and
compile them as if they were royal - redoing the compilation if
subsequent classes negate the royalty.


--- Extends by Forwarding -------------------------------------------

Extending by forwarding means that a slot is nominated to hold an
instance of the superclass.  All the slot-accessors of the superclass
are redirected to the embedded instance - but may be overridden or augmented 
in the obvious fashion.
