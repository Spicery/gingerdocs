On Printing and Showing
Message dated 28/July/03

The latest addition to the JSpice interpreter are the 8 built-in functions

    print( x1, ..., xN )         print items to stdout
    show( x1, ..., xN )          debug-print items to stdout
    
    println( x1, ..., xN )       print items then a newline to stdout
    showln( x1, ..., xN )        debug-print items then a newline to stdoout

    printTo( w, x1, ..., xN )    print items to writer w
    showTo( w, x1, ..., xN )     debug-print items to writer w
    
    printlnTo( w, x1, ..., xN )  print items then a newline to w
    showlnTo( w, x1, ..., xN )   debug-print items then a newline to w

This is a small family of functions for writing to standard-output (or
arbitrary output-stream).  The "show" group are used for debugging
and is intended for programmers.  The "print" group is used to 
write text to the screen/file.

To see the difference, consider printing/showing a String.  If you
-show- a String you will want to see the double-quotes.  If you -print-
a String you only want to see the contents.  Similarly, -show- a
list and you'll see the enclosing braces and the comma-separated
contents.  If you print a list you just get the recursively printed
members.

  Welcome to JSpice
  :-) showln( "foo" );
  "foo"
  :-) println( "foo" );
  foo
  :-) showln( { 1, 2, 3 } );
  {1, 2, 3}
  :-) println( { 1, 2, 3 } );
  123
  :-) 

Another key difference is that if you -show- several items they will
be separated by commas but -print- has no separator.

  :-) showln('abc' );
  'a', 'b', 'c'
  :-) println( 'abc' );
  abc

I believe that separating these two roles has been very beneficial.
Trying to pack too much into a single way of printing doesn't
work, as Java demonstrates so nicely!
