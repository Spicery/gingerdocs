<h1>Memo: Phone call between Steve Leach (SFKL) and Chris Dollin (CJD), Thursday 30/8/01.

<ol>
	<li><p>
"public import" to be revised to permit inclusion into other facets.  
We suggest either of the following :-
</p>

<pre>
    import [alias =] packagename [facet facetname] [into facetname]
    [facet facetname] import [alias =] packagename [facet facetname]
</pre>
<p>
Note that "into" will remain a reserved word.
</p>
</li>

	<li><p>
Various reserved words have become ordinary identifiers.  [I didn't record all of these but I recall "opt", "mode", "style", "help".  The only one of significance to MillScript was "all" - SFKL.]
</p>
</li>

	<li><p>
We have agreed to experiment with "val" as a synonym for "const" and, if all goes well, we will eventually deprecate "const".  This will have significant impact on MillScript so it will take a while for SFKL to push this through.
</p>
</li>

	<li><p>
We are agreed to the principle of making Spice the best possible language within its intrinsic limits.  This means that we are committed to change and taking our userbase with us.  In practice this means that MillScript will lag Spice - but that's not a big problem.
</p>
</li>

	<li><p>
SFKL agreed to send CJD his mapping from Spice syntax to XML along with relevant comments.
