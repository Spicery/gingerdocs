<h1>Memo: Meeting, Monday 15th October 2001</h1>

<h2>Participants</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chris Dollin (CJD)</li>
<li>Steve Leach (SFKL)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Agenda</h2>
<p>
To resolve the issues that arise from symmetric multiple inheritance and symmetric multiple dispatch.  In effect this was a check back on the initial design decision to use symmetric inheritance and dispatch.
</p>


<h2>Discussion</h2>

<ol type="1">

<li>
<p>
We outlined the ambiguity that arise from symmetric multiple inheritance
and symmetric multiple dispatch.
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Symmetric multiple inheritance gives rise to an ambiguity in
this situation.
</p>
<pre>
    define class A
        define generic M() =&gt; "a" enddefine
    enddefine

    define class P extends A
        define method M() =&gt; "p" enddefine
    endclass

    define class Q extends A
        define method M() =&gt; "q" enddefine
    enddefine

    define class X extends P, Q
    enddefine

    # What happens now?
    M( new X() )
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Symmetric multiple dispatch gives rise to an ambiguity in this
situation.</p>
<pre>
    define class A
    enddefine

    define class P extends A
    endclass

    define generic M( a:A, p:P ) =&gt; "1" enddefine

    define generic M( p:P, a:A ) =&gt; "2" enddefine

    # What happens now?
    M( new P(), new P() )
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>Closely related to these ambiguities is the technique used for
method extension.  We outlined three techniques :-
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Before/after extensions.  The weakness of this technique is that
method overriding does not affect the before/after extensions and
that separate overrides need to be performed.  Naturally enough
before/after extensions is a useful technique but we regard it as
wholly unsuitable for implementing method extension.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call-next-method.  The weakness of this technique is that it
exacerbates the ambiguous situations outlined in (1a) and (1b) above.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signature-based method selection.  The weakness of this
technique is that it is an unstructured and potentially
dangerous approach.  However, it does provide a basis for solving
the ambiguities.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>


<li>
<p>We agreed that our aims were to provide a means for programmers
to resolve ambiguities that does not require a degree in comp.
sci., that is reasonably elegant to use especially for the common
case of (effectively) single inheritance and dispatch, and preserves
inheritance transparency.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>After some debate we adopted the following hybrid between
call-next-method and signature based method selection.  Within
a method definition the keyword -super- is used to invoke the next
most general version of the method i.e. call-next-method.  However,
to resolve ambiguity it may be decorated with a signature to select
a unique preference from the available choices.  (No spelling for
this decoration was chosen and so, for the purposes of this memo,
I shall write this as percent-decorated-brackets.)
</p>
<p>
To illustrate this idea, here is how the technique resolves our
two examples above.
</p>
<p>
The resolution of situation (1a) is that the programmer is
required to implement M for X and indicate preference.  e.g.
</p>
<pre>
    define method M( x : X ) =&gt;
        # Choose P's definition, not Q's.
        super[% P %]( x )
    enddefine
</pre>
<p>
The resolution of situation (1b) is that the programmer is
required to implement M for (P,P) and indicate preference e.g.
</p>

<pre>
    define method M( p1 : P, p2 : P ) =&gt;
        # Choose the definition whose first parameter is closest to A.
        super[% A, _ %]( p1, p2 )
    enddefine
</pre>
<p>
Note that the "_" symbol may be used to indicate no preference for
a particular argument position, and "_..." for variadic arguments.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>We think it should be an error for the signature-based preference
mechanism to specify a signature that "skips" an intervening definition.
However, there are further subtle problems that can arise here
with respect to inheritance transparency.  i.e. when someone adds new
intervening classes into the implementation of a class.  It is possible
that the signature used for selection should be read in a more flexible
fashion - choose the next method whose signature looks most like this.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>We note that this mechanism provides a way of resolving ambiguities
due to symmetric multiple inheritance, symmetric multiple dispatch, and
method extension.  Hurrah!
</p>
</li>
</ol>
