So the following example is legal Spice syntax. 		</p><pre>    if x &gt; 0 then    	unless x &gt; y then            p()    	endunless    elseif y &gt; 0 do    	unless x &gt; y do            q()    	endunless     endif</pre> 	</li>	<li>		<p>			SFKL believes that <tt>then</tt> and <tt>do</tt> should be interchangeable throughout Spice but this option is incompatible with the use of <tt>then</tt> in the <tt>while</tt> and <tt>until</tt> syntax. SFKL requests a reconsideration of the latter decision.  CJD agrees to this, this issue being finding a viable replacement for the keyword <tt>then</tt>.	</li>	<li>		<p>			SFKL raises the question of whether <tt>absent</tt>/<tt>true</tt>/<tt>false</tt> should be treated as reserved words or ordinary identifiers. CJD analyses the issue as follows. 		</p>		<ul>			<li>				<p>					In favour of identifiers: they have no properties that cannot be possessed by identifiers, bar one (below). The parser does not need to know that they are special, so they don't need special tokens. Having them as identifiers reduces the load on the lexer. 				</p>			</li>			<li>				<p>					In favour of reserved words: you don't want to be able to [re]declare them. 				</p>			</li>			<li>				<p>					The one property: they can't be redeclared. 				</p>			</li>		</ul>	</li>	<li>		<p>			CJD suggests the following resolution: add another standard attribute, <tt>pervasive</tt>. Pervasive identifiers cannot be redeclared in a nested scope. Then make true/false/absent/nil/termin/String/Absent/Small/Vector etc pervasive. Hence they are then neither reserved words nor ordinary identifiers.  SFKL observes that the pervasive attribute could be applied at the level of packages and/or facets.		</p>	</li></ol></body></html>
