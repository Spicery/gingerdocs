<h1>Memo: Phone call between Steve Leach (SFKL) and Chris Dollin (CJD), Friday 07/09/2001.
</h1>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Prompted by a query from Mark Summers with regard to the declaration of
facet names, we agreed to add a <tt>facets</tt> clause to package declarations.
e.g.
</p>
<pre>
	package foo.bar
	facets alpha, beta
	imports trog.gort;
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>We did not clarify the spelling of facets as facet/facets.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>We did not clarify whether or not facet names could be reserved
words.  SFKL believes that they should following the same spelling rules
as ordinary identifiers.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
We agreed to introduce <tt>facet common</tt> for the role of shared identifiers
between the members of a package family. 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>We did not clarify whether <tt>common</tt> was to have the same syntactic status
as <tt>public</tt> and <tt>private</tt>.  [SFKL tends to think this is what being well-known 
means.]
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>We talked about threads, coroutines and tasks.  Although there is no
absolutely clear terminology, SFKL says that there is a reasonable agreement
that threads and coroutines share memory but threads are preemptively 
scheduled and share memory whereas coroutines are cooperatively scheduled.
The term "tasks" is set aside for preemptively scheduled processes that
run in separate virtual machines, possibly on separate processors.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>SFKL suggests that Spice should have coroutines and tasks but not
threads - in view of the mess Java makes of them.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>CJD suggests that tasks should be able to communicate via <em>shared</em>
variables (borrowing Eiffel vocabulary).  These shared variables become
implicit synchronization points, obviously enough.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
We had a long discussion about the way to avoid embedding package names
in programs.  The problem is <tt>import &lt;package name&gt;</tt>.  We agreed that this
needed addressing later.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>We also discussed whether or not packages and/or facet names should
refer to run-time representations of the same.  SFKL was against this.
His argument is that the package mechanism is merely a way of managing
the mapping from syntactic names to semantic entities for the 
convenience of the human programmer.  
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>SFKL outlined the "publish" mechanism proposed for Palantir 
(a web application server with embedded Spice interpreter)
which <em>does</em> make a run-time representation of explicitly
selected packages available.  The hope is that this limits the 
damage done by exposing the programmer selected names.
