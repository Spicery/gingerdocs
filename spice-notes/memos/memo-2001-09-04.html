<h1>Memo: Phone call between Steve Leach (SFKL) and Chris Dollin (CJD), Tuesday 04/09/2001.
</h1>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
The call was prompted by SFKL wanting to double-check on the syntax of
conditionals in loops.  The answer is, roughly speaking
</p>
<pre>
    while E [ (then|else) E ]
</pre>
<p>
There was a short conversation regarding the advisability of reusing
then/else in this role.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
SFKL took the opportunity of pointing out an experimental addition
to the loop syntax he is experimenting with.  These is the "dofor" syntax
which is used to implement nesting iterations within a single loop.  e.g.
</p>
<pre>
    for i from 1 to 3
    dofor j from 1 to i
    do
        println( { i, j } )
    endfor;
    { 1, 1 }
    { 2, 1 }
    { 2, 2 }
    { 3, 1 }
    { 3, 2 }
    { 3, 3 }
</pre>
<p>
The main point is that all exits from this loop are exits of the entire loop
and not just an inner loop.  There are no inner loops in that respect.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
A second experimental addition made by SFKL was the introduction of Iterators.
The forms "in E" and "from E to E" (etc) are considered valid expressions
yielding values called Iterators.  SFKL is uncommitted as to what these are
except that they work nicely in for loops.  In MillScript, of course, they
are Java Iterators.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
SFKL was also interested in checking out a sceanrio with regard to
the proposed interpretation of "top-level" binding.  In a previous memo, we
agreed to unify the interpretation of bindings within a definition and 
top-level.  The means CJD proposed to achieve this is that a sequence of
"define" statements are mutually recursive.  This implicit "letrec" context 
is broken by the first top-level expression (or the end of the statement
context).  It is worth noting that neither of us is entirely sure whether
val/var statements break the recursive context or not.
</p>

<p>
[Now I come to write this up, surely we would have debated the use of
    <tt>define val foo = E enddefine</tt>
to ensure the continuation of the recursive context?  However I do not
recall this.  Given the state of my memory at present this is somewhat
inconclusive.]
</p>

<p>
The scenario is illustrated by the following example.
</p>

<pre>
    package foo;
    val foo = "foo";
    endpackage;

    package bar;
    import foo;

    val bar = foo;      # this _must_ be foo::foo

    println( "end implicit letrec" );

    val foo = "bar";    # but which is this?

    endpackage;
</pre>

<p>
CJD responded definitely that the questioned definition should cause 
a compile-time error along the lines of this (using MillScript's error 
reporting format) :-
</p>
 
<pre>
    MISHAP:         Trying to redeclare implicitly declared identifier
    REASON:         An imported identifier has been implicitly declared 
                    by being referred to without "::"
    IDENTIFIER:     foo
    IMPORTED FROM:  package foo
    SUGGESTION:     Use foo::foo instead of foo and this will avoid an
                    implicit declaration
    LINE:           12
</pre>

<p>
After some further discussion about the pros and cons of this approach
SFKL finally saw sense and agreed.
