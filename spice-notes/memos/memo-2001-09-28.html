<h2>Discussion</h2>

<ol>
	<li><p>
Prompted by the addition of regular expressions to Spice/Palantir, SFKL and CJD noted several incompatibilities between Spice strings and the conventional regular expression syntax, exemplified by Perl 4.  In particular, \s means a space inside a Spice string but a 1-character regexp that matches any whitespace character inside Perl.  Also \( starts a Spice string insertion but means a 1-character regexp matching an open parenthesis in Perl.
</p>
</li>

	<li><p>
We perceive two distinct kinds of compatibility, compatibility with Perl regexps and compatibility with Spice strings.  We decided to resolve this conflict by having two syntaxes for regular expressions <i>traditional</i> and <i>native</i>.  The traditional syntax would maximize compatibility with Perl / JavaScript / Java.  The native syntax would vary the convention to suit the Spice programmer.
</p>
</li>

	<li><p>
The traditional regular expression would be introduced with // and terminate with /.  This allows cut and paste of regular expressions.
e.g. //abc.*def/
</p>
</li>

	<li><p>
The native syntax will use /" and terminate with ".  This emphasizes the connection to Spice strings.  It will also allow us to make a better selection of metacharacters (such as avoiding the troublesome ".") e.g. /"abc?*def"
</p>
</li>
</ol>
