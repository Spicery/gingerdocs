Suggestions are ":&gt;" and ":-".  Concern was expressed about avoiding symbols which small typing errors could turn into hard-to-diagnose problems.</p><p><i>Aside: The symbol that was finally adopted was <tt>==&gt;</tt> which is understood to be ASCII-art for Unicode 21A6 (&#x21A6;).</i></p></li><li><p>CJD agreed to deprecate the use of "&amp;" in Spice in favour of "++" as append operator.</p></li><li><p>Both SFKL &amp; CJD agreed to use "++" as append operator i.e. 'polymorphic concatenation'.  We are both agreed on the need for the arguments to be type-compatible.</p></li><li><p>The syntax for holes has been fixed as "?" or "?n" where n is a small positive integer.  If any hole is labelled by a number, all holes in the same expression must also be labelled.  (i.e. ?2 + ? is not legal.)  The "^" operator is reserved.  The intended use is denoting match variables.</p><p>Furthermore, it is agreed that "?" is able to deal with short-circuit operators as well.  In particular, "? and ?" means the functional version of boolean and.  Compilers are expected to generate code that avoids needless copying when all the arguments are holes.</p></li><li><p>CJD agreed to replace the postfix type operator "?" with "??".  "<i>type</i>??" is intended to mean the anonymous union of <i>type</i> with Absent.</p></li><li><p>The "$" symbol is to be reserved.  The intended use is accessing environment variables.</p></li><li><p>SFKL agreed to augment the newMap operator to permit initialization using maplets &amp; other maps.  Furthermore there will be another constructor with the form</p><pre>	alistToMap( k1, v1, k2, v2, ..., kN, vN ) -&gt; map</pre></li><li><p>Both agreed that "%" and "//" should be reserved.  Roles not determined.  CJD pointed out that "/:" is currently allocated the roles of "fractional" division and that perhaps "//" should take over that role.</p></li></ol></body></html>
