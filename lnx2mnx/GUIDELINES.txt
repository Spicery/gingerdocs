Documentation Guidelines for lnx2mnx, the extensible parser
-----------------------------------------------------------

* This parser sits between two well-defined formats, namely LinX and MinX. 

* Readers are likely to have one of the following goals
  - Those who want to add a DSL into their Ginger IDE
  - Those who would like to implement a DSL in a different context.
  - Those who want to replace lnx2mnx with their own tool.
  - They want to understand its role in the architecture of the Ginger IDE.

* The grammar file is unique to this program and so should be detailed in this folder and no where else.

* The LinX and MinX formats are useful in a variety of settings. They should be casually described here and the reader guided to the file-format section for reference.
